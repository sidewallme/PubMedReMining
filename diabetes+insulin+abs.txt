it is suggested that insulin insensitivity probably precedes the appearance of vascular disease in diabetes and may be implicated in its production
 the mcr in eight patients with insulin-independent diabetes mellitus (iid) (185 +/-41 ml/min) and in eight patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (idd) (136 +/-31 ml/min) were significantly different from control subjects (p = &lt; 0
 some of the patients had uncontrolled diabetes in the early morning, when severe hyperglycaemia and hyperketonaemia occurred together, while later during the same day or night an episode of hypoglycaemia caused hyperketonaemia, indicating that too much insulin had been given
  the condition resembles prediabetes or diabetes of pregnancy, with elevated oral glucose tolerance test, cortisone-glucose test, free fatty acids, insulinemia, and growth hormone

 diabetes after removal of insulin tumours of pancreas: a long-term follow-up survey of 11 patients
 it seemed possible that the presence of glucose or its metabolites within the alpha cell might be essential for suppression of glucagon secretion, and that in diabetes an intracellular deficiency of glucose secondary to insulin lack might be responsible for the nonsuppressibility
 diabetes induced in rats by anti-insulin serum was also associated with significant elevation in plasma glucagon
 the plasma immuno-reactive insulin response in 12 patients (80 percent) was of a pattern observed in patients with maturity-onset diabetes

 the effect of growth hormone, insulin and alloxan-induced diabetes on carcinogenesis in the genital tract of intact and castrate female rats
 castrate female rats given weekly applications of dmba to the genital tract and treated additionally with growth hormone, insulin or alloxan (to induce diabetes) are heavier and have more sarcomatous and epithelial cervico-vaginal neoplasms than intact animals under the same experimental conditions
 the refractory state of these patients' responses to the normal stimulus of insulin output has similarities to the picture in juvenile diabetes mellitus and may be important in the aetiology of the small-vessel lesions
 the pattern of insulin levels during the afternoon and evening tests resembled that described as typical of maturity-onset diabetes
 although the specific mechanism(s) that alters both the sensitivity and responsiveness of the normal pancreatic fetal islet to insulinogenic stimuli remains unclear, the data do indicate that insulin-dependent maternal hyperglycemia and hyperaminoacidemia, separately or in combination could contribute to the fetal hyperinsulinemia of pregnancies complicated by diabetes mellitus

 the effect of insulin on the alpha-cell response to hyperglycemia in long-standing alloxan diabetes
 in acute experimental diabetes in animals, alpha-cell unresponsiveness to hyperglycemia can be promptly corrected by insulin, but in human diabetes, even massive doses of insulin have little effect
 to determine if this inability of insulin to correct the alpha-cell abnormality in man is merely the consequence of the long duration of the diabetic state (rather than of a difference in mechanism), the effect of insulin was studied in alloxan diabetes of long duration
 to determine if small amounts of insulin would similarly restore alpha-cell responsiveness in long-standing experimental diabetes, 1

 hepatic autography in uncontrolled experimental diabetes and its relationships to insulin and glucagon
 to determine if the hormones of the pancreatic islets influence the development of these organelles glycogenosomes, dense bodies, and autophagosomes were morphometrically quantitated in normal rats, in rats with mild streptozotocin diabetes with normal hormone levels, and in rats with severe streptozotocin diabetes with hyperglucagonemia, hypo-insulinemia, and clinical evidence of uncontrolled diabetes and ketoacidosis
 insulin treatment corrected the hyperglucagonemia, hypoinsulinemia, and other manifestations of uncontrolled diabetes and reduced the volume density of lysosomes to 37
 in mild streptozotocin diabetes, in which hyperglucagonemia, hypoinsulinemia, and other evidence of uncontrolled diabetes were absent, lysosomes averaged 77
 it is concluded that uncontrolled streptozotocin diabetes in rats is accompanied by hepatic autophagy which may be related to the increased plasma glucagon level and/or the decreased insulin and which is corrected by insulin therapy

 in acute diabetes (6 to 24 hours after repeated anti-insulin serum injections) p-creatine, fructose diphosphate, and lactate levels were normal
 insulin (and glucose) appeared to be specific in correcting the metabolic abnormalities found in the brains of animals with alloxan-induced diabetes
 the following evidence suggests that diabetes mellitus may not be the simple consequence of relative or absolute insulin deficiency by itself, but may require the presence of glucagon: (1) relative or absolute hyperglucogonaemia has been identified in every form of endogenous hyperglycaemia, including total pancreatectomy in dogs; (2) insulin lack in the absence of glucagon does not cause endogenous hyperglycaemia, but when endogenous or exogenous glucagon is present, it quickly appears, irrespective of insulin levels at the time
 these facts are compatible with a bihormonal-abnormality hypothesis, which holds that the major consequence of absolute or relative insulin lack is glucose underutilisation and that absolute or relative glucagon excess is the principal factor in the over-production of glucose in diabetes
  no evidence was found that subjects destined to develop diabetes have either excessive or diminished insulin secretion
 no mothers were found to have a gestational diabetes (with the possible exception of one low insulin responders) but during late pregnancy the mean k-value at ivgtt in the low responders decreased from non-pregnant values (the mean difference being 0

 additional studies were performed in which control subjects and patients with diabetes had their fasting plasma glucose levels acutely raised or lowered to comparable levels before receiving the basic infusion mixture of glucose, insulin, epinephrine, and propranolol
 since previous studies have documented the presence of insulin resistance in patients with chemical diabetes, the possibility exists that insulin resistance may be characteristic of adult onset diabetes mellitus
 to evaluate the role of glucagon in the pathogenesis of diabetic ketoacidosis in man, we studied the effect of suppression of glucagon secretion by somatostatin on changes in plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate and glucose concentrations (as well as changes in their precursors) after acute withdrawal of insulin from seven patients with juvenile-type diabetes
 first, it was shown that obese, supposedly ketosis resistant, subjects may deteriorate in a brief time span from a state of normal glucose disposal and adequate or increased insulin responses to insulin-deficient diabetes, culminating in ketoacidosis

 a young woman with diabetes mellitus developed chronic urticaria after changing from isophane been insulin suspension to isophane beef-pork insulin suspension
 these findings reconfirm that the earliest clinically recognizable state of diabetes mellitus is characterized by an impaired initial insulin secretory response to glycemic stimulus
 they also indicate that valid interpretations of the influence of mild diabetes per se on the early insulin response can only be drawn from data obtained in nonobese individuals
 cell-mediated immunity in diabetes mellitus; lymphocyte transformation by insulin and insulin fragments in insulin-treated and newly-diagnosed diabetes

 bcm accumulation is independent of food intake, except protein, and depends on normal physiologic adjustments of pregnancy, which are upset by insulin lack in diabetes
 from this information it may be concluded that the importance of various risk factors in the diabetic chiefly varies according to the vascular territory involved: cerebral vascular accidents occur mainly in hypertensives, while the presence of retinopathies, proteinuria and peripheral ischemia is directly related to the diabetes and particularly to insulin dependence
 we report on the case of a 10-month-old infant with down's syndrome and acute insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, who died of hyperosmolar diabetic coma 4 days after admission to the hospital in spite of intensive therapy
 in the families of mody: 1) twenty-two of twenty-six (85 per cent) propositi had a diabetic parent; 2) 46 per cent of families showed direct vertical transmission of diabetes through three generations; 3) of forty-seven tested siblings twenty-five (53 per cent) had latent diabetes; 4) the diabetic phenotype in the families was consistent, most affected individuals having a noninsulin requiring type of disease

 absence of insulin resistance in 4 cases of mild juvenile diabetes
 four children with a mild non-insulin-requiring diabetes were studied
 these results suggests that a peripheral resistance to insulin is unlikely in mild juvenile diabetes, and that the primary defect is a deficient release of insulin
 there was no discernible relationship between the abnormality of external pancreatic function and the duration of diabetes mellitus or the dose of insulin required
 recognition of this has resulted in better management of diabetes with relatively small doses of insulin
 we conclude that a single, standard 2-h oral glucose tolerance test should be considered only as a screening test for diabetes mellitus, and that a final diagnosis of chemical diabetes mellitus should be made only if the carbohydrate in-tolerance consistently worsens or if insulin curves show hypofunction of the islets of langerhans
 in only one of eight subjects receiving oral hypoglycemic agents for the control of diabetes did a significant immediate increase in immunoreactive insulin follow administration of tmp-smx

  it was demonstrated that in rats with latent alloxan diabetes sensitivity of adipose tissue to insulin was unchanged in comparison with control rats
  sensitivity of adipose tissue to insulin was significantly reduced in the patients with latent diabetes mellitus in comparison with control
  the data obtained indicated that reduction of the sensitivity of adipose tissue to insulin in patients with latent diabetes mellitus served as a primary factor in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus, responsible for the appearance of a relative insulin deficiency
 [the contractile capacity of the myocardium, the effect of insulin on it and indices of central hemodynamics in patients with diabetes mellitus]
 the intravenous application of 60 mg streptozotocin/kg body weight to a hanford miniature pig 8 days after a first dose of 30 mg/kg led to a diabetes with loss of insulin response to glucose, hyperglycaemia, glucosuria and a considerable increase of triglycerides and cholesterol
 these observations demonstrate that islet tissue implanted in the peritoneal cavities of diabetic rats receiving immunosuppressive chronic corticosteroid therapy can respond with a rapid and sufficient release of insulin to reverse diabetes as documented by normal glucose levels under stimulated and nonstimulated conditions
 glucose-induced potentiation of glucose-induced insulin release was quantitatively evaluated in 14 non-obese subjects with normal glucose tolerance but decreased insulin response, and in six non-obese patients with mild, adult-onset diabetes, by measuring the insulin responses to two consecutive glucose infusion tests, administered with 40 or 70 min interval

 thyroid autoimmunity: increased frequency in relatives of insulin-dependent diabetes patients
 the poor correlation between presence of thyroid autoimmunity and duration of disease and the significantly increased prevalence of thyroid antibodies in first-degree relatives of insulin-dependent probands are interpreted to suggest that thyroid autoimmunity in probands with insulin-dependent diabetes is not secondary to diabetes
 this finding suggests that there are several kinds of insulin-dependent diabetes, one of which may be an "autoimmune" disease
 phagocytic properties of exudative microphages from animals with alloxan diabetes and insulin-induced hypoglycemia
 phagocytosis was studied in exudative microphages from white mice with alloxan diabetes and insulin-induced hypoglycemia
 the experiments showed that: 1) lowered phagocytic indices in animals with alloxan diabetes and insulin-induced hypoglycemia indicate lower phagocytic capability of exudative microphages; 2) normal phagocytosis depends on: a) normal blood levels of glucose as energetic material, and b) adequate concentration of insulin in tissues as enzymatic "transporter" of glucose
 it had a similar effect in rats with moderately severe diabetes, but it did not increase glucose uptake in rats with diabetic ketoacidosis or in hindquarters of fed rats that had been "washed out" with an insulin-free perfusate

 diminishing sensitivity to insulin was reflected in an increasing fasting plasma insulin and insulin/glucose ratio except in patients with diabetes
 it was postulated that the poor adrenal medullary response to the insulin injection may be a contributing factor in the excessive hypoglycaemic response, and that the diabetes mellitus observed in the patients could be due to inactivation of endogenous insulin
 [protective effect of some hormones (insulin, testosterone, human chorionic gonadotropins) on testicular damage in alloxan diabetes in rats]

 [plasma insulin-binding capacity of diabetes mellitus patients with labile and stable courses]
 clinical picture of diabetes mellitus in the patients treated with insulin is characterized by a labile or stable course
 it is supposed that of significance in the character of diabetes mellitus were antibodies formed in response to the exogenous insulin
 stable diabetes was characterized by the appearance in the blood of antibodies with a high insulin affinity, this being confirmed by an increase in the insulin-binding capacity of the blood plasma
 it is concluded that the  metabolic effects of estrogen-progestin combinations are more serious in many diabetics, and their use often increases the need for exogenous insulin, as well as the tendency to hyperlipemia, excessive weight gain, and hypertension, which are  all factors that aggravate diabetes

 insulin dose and metabolic characteristics of the diabetes showed little clear association with arterial pressure but, as expected, patients with evidence of renal disease had higher mean pressures
 these metabolic abnormalities, in association with porto-caval shunting and hepatocyte insufficiency may explain the insulin resistance which characterises liver cirrhosis, and the diabetes which it may precipitate in predisposed persons
 several arguments have been accumulated in favor of the following concept: diabetes hyperglycemia results both from glucose under-utilization secondary to insulin lack and from hepatic glucose over-production due to glucagon excess
 no differences existed in insulin requirements, age and duration of diabetes between childhood diabetics with or without significant titers of insulin antibodies
 achrestic diabetes associated with peripheral resistance is regarded as the cause of insulin resistance in juvenile patients possessing no major amounts of antibody

 to assess the influence of diabetes mellitus on bone metabolism, we measured skeletal mass in the forearms of 35 patients with juvenile diabetes on insulin and 101 stable patients with adult-onset diabetes, on diet alone, insulin, or oral hypoglycemic agents
 these data are consistent with the hypothesis that the loss of skeletal tissue in diabetes reflects the underlying disease since it occurs early and is not related to severity as evidenced by the need for insulin, to duration, or to treatment with insulin or diet alone

 in three patients there was complete restoration of normal b-cell function with complete remission of the diabetes, in four there was incomplete regeneration of endogenous insulin secretion and of effective insulin reserve
 plasma glucagon and the insulin:glucagon ratio in gestational diabetes
 in a pair of 19-year-old monozygotic twin girls, one developed insulin-dependent, ketosis-prone diabetes at the age of three and has required insulin for the past 16 years
 in three patients with adult and two with juvenile-onset diabetes on maintenance insulin, hyperglucagonemia maintained for two to four days caused no change in plasma glucose of ketone concentration

 one sibling had mild obesity and diabetes mellitus, one had moderate obesity, normal glucose tolerance and hyperinsulinism and the third had abnormal glucose tolerance and hyperinsulinism
 nonketotic diabetes mellitus: insulin deficiency or insulin resistance? ninety-five nonobese, nonketotic subjects were divided into five groups (one normal and four with varying degrees of glucose intolerance) according to their plasma glucose responses during an oral glucose tolerance test
 the mean plasma insulin response of patients with either borderline abnormalities of glucose tolerance or chemical diabetes was equal to or greater than that of normal subjects at all points during the glucose tolerance test
 these results indicate that there is a very complex relationship between insulin deficiency and insulin resistance in patients currently classified as having nonketotic diabetes
 patients with either borderline abnormal glucose tolerance or chemical diabetes are more resistant to insulin than normal subjects, and are not insulin deficient
 it seems apparent from these studies that nonketotic diabetes mellitus can no longer be considered to be a simple function of insulin lack, and that in order to understand this syndrome we will need to increase our knowledge of the relationship between insulin deficiency and insulin resistance in these patients
 in patients under treatment with insulin, chlorpropamide, or phenformin the diabetes was well controlled in most cases, but these patients did not have significantly lower lipid levels
 diet and oral antidiabetic drugs and plasma sugar and insulin levels in patients with maturity-onset diabetes mellitus

 the acute and late phases of insulin secretion were studied in mongrel dogs before and after the induction of mild alloxan diabetes
 the present observations in alloxan-induced mild diabetes in dogs suggest that reduced early-phase secretion and intact later phase of insulin secretion are not dependent on genetic determinants and may be induced in a model of acquired diabetes

 the findings suggest that insulin-dependent diabetes may be a disease of autoaggression
 [the effect of glipizide on the blood glucose and insulin in non-ketotic diabetes mellitus (author's transl)]
 in one patient with insulinopenic diabetes glipizide had only a very small effect on the blood glucose and insulin concentration
 these results are a further indication that sulphonylurea agents should be administered only in the case of certain specific types of diabetes, because no therapeutic response can be expected in diabetes caused by insulinopenia and insulin resistance
 maximum stimulation of insulin secretion in children with chemical diabetes and obesity
 five siblings of patients with diabetes sound to have chemical diabetes had hyperinsulinism during the ogtt

 the results of the trial may be summarised as follows: monocomponent insulin appears to be very effective in patients with insulin allergy, adipopathy, and possibily in some patients in whom diabetes is not controlled with large doses of insulin
 the clinical effects of glucocorticoids on carbohydrate metabolism were reviewed, and four general points were made: (1) the chronic effects of corticoids on glucose tolerance are much less pronounced than the acute effects; (2) the degree of impariment is proportional to the pre-existing status of glucose tolerance; (3) development of frank diabetes mellitus in a previously normal patient is unusual; and (4) the abnormalities of carbohydrate metabolism induced by glucocorticoids fit the pattern of an insulin resistant state
 beta-cell function improved by supplementing basal insulin secretion in mild diabetes
 insulin supplements, predominantly as a constant basal fish insulin infusion, were given to patients with mild diabetes to reduce the overnight fasting glucose level to normal
 the beta-cell in diabetes seems to be in a vicious circle in which an impaired insulin response to glucose produces hyperglycaemia, which stresses beta-cell function, making it more inefficient
 a constant basal insulin supplement to induce basal normoglycaemia may benefit beta-cell function in diabetes
 in order to measure the effect of a diabetic day-care unit on diabetes control two scoring scales were constructed, one for insulin-dependent diabetics and the other for patients managed by diet or oral agents or both

 an absolute or relative insulin deficiency is a characteristic of diabetes mellitus, in which a relative hyperglucagonemia is also of possible pathophysiological significance
 while the clinical application of somatostatin in diabetes mellitus seems problematic at present, the use of a glucose-controlled system of insulin infusion ("artificial pancreas") makes possible a metabolic state approaching the healthy condition
 [comparison of the nature of insulin secretion, determined by radioimmune and biological methods, normally and in diabetes mellitus]
 the early serum insulin response to intravenous glucose in patients with decreased glucose tolerance and in subjects with a familial history of diabetes mellitus
 the possible predictive value for later diabetes mellitus of early serum insulin response after intravenous glucose administration was evaluated by studying subjects with a familial history of diabetes mellitus and patients with different degrees of glucose intolerance
 serum insulin values in patients with decreased glucose tolerance and subjects with a familial history of diabetes mellitus were best characterized by an insulin concentration index (glucose-stimulated early serum insulin concentration divided by basal serum insulin concentration)
 treatment of a hepatic gastrinoma by streptozotocin infusion into the hepatic artery in a patient with diabetes mellitus and hyperinsulinism almost normalized his glucose tolerance and insulin secretion

 treatment of diabetes with or without insulin was problem-free
 insulin antibodies in 104 children with diabetes mellitus
 cases of diabetes, which are difficult to control, treated with individual mixtures of porcine and bovine insulin, often showed high binding for porcine and also for human insuline
 thus, acute stz-induced diabetes in rats was associated with a significant decrease in both serum sm and cartilage growth activity; these changes were not ameliorated by administration of gh, and insulin therapy could both prevent and reverse the fall in sm and cartilage growth activity
 from these observations, we conclude that (1) that fall in somatomedin activity and cartilage growth activity associated with stz-induced diabetes appears to be due to insulin deficiency and (2) growth failure in diabetes, as in malnutrition, may be due to decreased somatomedin activity
 in nine children with clinically overt insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus the authors injected cyclic somatostatin (3 mug
 hypoglycemia in diabetes can be divided into 1) spontaneous hypoglycemic reactions due to absolute or relative overproduction of endogenous insulin or some other blood glucose-lowering substance, as in islet cell adenoma or carcinoma, latent or protodiabetic conditions, (extrapancreatic) tumors and pituitary and/or adrenal disorders; and 2) hypoglycemia caused by exogenous, i
 an exaggerated insulin response to oral glucose was associated with reactive hypoglycemia in the post-gastrectomy syndrome, in normal-weight patients with chemical diabetes and 44% of the patients with the isolated syndrome
 in contrast, plasma-insulin values cannot account for the reactive hypoglycemia observed in obese patients (with or without chemical diabetes), in subjects with renal glycosuira and in 56% of the patients with the isolated syndrome

 [the pathogenesis of the insulin-resistant form of diabetes mellitus]
 the level of the radioimmunological growth hormone, free fatty acids and sugar was determined in the blood on fasting stomach and after the intravenous injection of insulin in 45 patients suffering from diabetes mellitus, insulin-resistant and sensitive, with consideration to body weight
 patients requiring for compensation of diabetes mellitus 100 units and more of insulin per day were referred to the group of resistant cases
 a significantly greater growth hormone content on fasting stomach 60 and 120 min after the administration of insulin was found in the sensitive patients with diabetes mellitus with a normal weight, in comparison with the group of healthy individuals; the content was also higher on fasting stomach and in 60 minutes in comparison with the group of sensitive diabetics with excessive weight
 adiposity characterized by reduction of the insulin sensitivity increased the requirements to the regulating system and led to reduction of the compensatory reaction at the stage of less severe sensitive diabetes
 in series i, the effect of four isocaloric, ordinary diabetic breakfast meals on the blood glucose level and on the urinary glucose loss was tested in 9 adult diabetes and three healthy subjects (ages 60 to 75) as well as in five insulin-treated diabetics (ages 18 to 40)
 to determine whether abnormalities in glucagon secretion might precede the onset of hyperglycemia in diabetes mellitus, 32 prediabetic pima (american) indians, 27 normal pima indians and 34 normal caucasians received an infusion of arginine monochloride (5 mg/kg/min for 40 minutes) with measurement of glucose, insulin, and glucagon
 insulin values were higher than those in the controls, with a pattern similar to that noted in subjects with chemical diabetes

 the pattern of insulin response to glucose is similar to that seen in typical mild maturity-onset diabetes
 insulin resistance and stability of diabetes are not related to properties of antibody dissociation
 the estrogen-binding capacity of mammary tumors induced by 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene was measured in lesions from animals after the ovariectomy, deprival of insulin (diabetes), or treatment with lergotrile mesylate to inhibit prolactin secretion
 none of these animals exhibited clearly defined  signs of diabetes mellitus and the incidence of induced lesions could not be correlated with levels of circulating insulin-binding antibodies
 locating the site(s) of insulin resistance in patients with nonketotic diabetes mellitus
 insulin resistance and the ability of insulin to inhibit hepatic glucose production and to increas efficiency of glucose uptake were determined in 24 nonobese individuals: eight subjects with normal oral glucose tolerance, eight patients with chemical diabetes, and eight nonketotic patients with fasting hyperglycemia (greater than 150 mg
 thus, insulin resistance exists in monoketotic diabetes, and the greater the degree of glucose intolerance, the greater the insulin resistance
 the resistance to the insulin infusion in patients with chemical diabetes seemed to be mainly a function of the inability of insulin to increase efficiency of glucose uptake, since insulin did retain its ability to inhibit glucose production (although not to normal levels)
 thus, the insulin resistance that exists in patients with nonketotic diabetes cannot be considered to be a global phenomenon
 is cigarette smoking more frequent among insulin-treated diabetics? during epidemiologic investigations of vascular complications of diabetes in warsaw the habit of cigarette smoking was analyzed in the subjects studied (4,530 diabetics)
 effect of diabetes mellitus and insulin on the turnover and metabolic response to ketones in man
 it is concluded that (1) ketone disposal is reduced in diabetes even when ketone production is normal, suggesting the rate of ketone utilization may be a more sensitive index of insulin deficiency than is ketone production; (2) hyperinsulinemia stimulates beta-hydroxybutyrate utilization without influencing acetoacetate concentration; and (3) increased blood ketone levels induced by infusion of na dl-beta-hydroxybutyrate reduce plasma glucose and alanine concentrations in diabetes
 these findings thus support a role for insulin in influencing ketone disposal in normal as well as diabetic man and a role for ketones in influencing substrate availability for gluconeogenesis in diabetes
 diabetes mellitus requiring insulin is a (relative) contra-indication to the use of glucagon
 the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the intravenous administration of xylitol and sorbitol respectively on plasma insulin and blood glucose in subjects with non-insulin requiring maturity-onset diabetes after an overnight fast
 to examine whether abnormal pancreatic alpha-cell function found in human diabetes mellitus may represent a selective insensitivity to glucose, plasma glucagon responses to hyperglycemia and elevation of plasma free fatty acid levels (both known suppressors of glucagon secretion) were compared in juvenile-onset, insulin-requiring diabetic subjects, and in normal nondiabetic subjects
 to determine if both phases of glucagon secretion are excessive in diabetes, arginine was admimistered intravenously as pulses and as infusions to normal subjects, insulin-dependent diabetics, and noninsulin-requiring diabetics
 it is suggested that a normal relationship between triglyceride concentration and insulin response to glucose is lost in chemical diabetes

 to assess further the role of insulin in the abnormal alpha-cell dysfunction found in human diabetes mellitus, the effects of acute insulin withdrawal and administration on plasma glucagon responses to intravenous arginine were studied in eight insulin-dependent diabetic subjects
 these results demonstrate a rapid effect of insulin on glucagon responses to arginine and suggest that the abnormal responses seen in diabetes mellitus are the immediate result of insulin deficiency
 since abnormal glucagon responses to glucose in diabetes are not as readily corrected by insulin, the mechanisms underlying the abnormal responses to these two stimuli may differ

 the results were related to the type of diabetes, to plasma triglyceride and insulin concentrations, to removal of exogenous fat from the blood, and to turnover of vldl-triglycerides 
 insulin treatment of ketotic diabetes resulted in a rapid increase in the activity of lpl and decrease in serum triglycerdie level, whereas sulfonylurea treatment of non-insulin-requiring diabetics did not significantly influence the enzyme activity
 the activity of lpl was correlated to basal plasma insulin concen tration in the insulin-deficient diabetes r = +0
 on the basis of these results it seems that a deficiency of lpl accounts for a great deal of the elevation of serum triglyceride in insulin-deficient human diabetes but has a smaller role in the pathogenesis of the hypertriglyceridemia that is associated with maturity-onset diabetes
 human proinsulin connecting peptide (c-peptide) was measured by immunoassay in urine from 25 normal subjects, 18 patients with diabetes mellitus, and 34 patients with various degrees of renal insufficiency

 insulin response to glucose or glucagon in subclinical diabetes previously injected with tolbutamide
 thirty-one patients with subclinical diabetes, who showed diabetic or impaired glucose tolerance after treatment for diabetes, were investigated in order to clarify the abnormalities of insulin response in diabetes mellitus
 in the tolbutamide-glucose test, in which glucose loading followed the intravenous tolbutamide injection at a 60-min interval, the insulin level at 90 min was significantly lowered in a group of 20 patients with subclinical diabetes
 in the tolbutamide-glucagon test, in which 1 mg of glucagon was injected 60 min after tolbutamide injection, the maximal level of plasma insulin was significantly decreased in a group of 10 subclinical diabetes except for one patient
 these results indicate that insulinogenesis and/or release of insulin were decreased even in subclinical diabetes, suggesting that such a defect in islet function might be one of the abnormalities in primary diabetes

 the data are consonant with the hypothesis that a shortage of insulin is only one of the multihormonal defects of diabetes
 insulin rather than glucose homoeostasis in the pathophysiology of diabetes

 these data suggest that diabetes mellitus occurs frequently in patients with thalassemia on htp and that insulin resistance and hyperglucagonemia, possibly due to cirrhosis, are important etiologic factors
 hla-types, c-peptide and insulin antibodies in juvenile diabetes
 serum c-peptide, insulin binding capacity of igg and total serum insulin, iri, were determined in 94 patients who had had diabetes for more than two years and who were beyond the remission period
3%) were lacking insulin antibodies; hla-bw15 positive patients had higher levels of insulin antibodies than other groups, while hla-b7 positive patients had lower levels; the results suggest that hla-b7 and hla-b18 might be associated with a different and perhaps milder form of juvenile diabetes

 incidence of insulin-dependent diabetes in the first sixteen years of life
 the incidence of insulin-dependent diabetes in the first 16 years of life in a nationally representative sample was 1-42 per 1000 population
 the glucose excretion was not significantly influenced by the frequency of insulin administration (one or two injections per day), by the age of the patient or by the duration of the diabetes mellitus
 the relations between a number of clinical and laboratory variables were analysed including the degree of ketosis and the insulin dose given at onset of diabetes, the incidence of postinitial remission period, the fasting c-peptide level after the remission period, the level of insulin antibodies and the actual diabetic control expressed as the degree of glucosuria in the patients' urine tests at home
 the results suggest that an early diagnosis followed by rapid normalization of the metabolism at the onset of juvenile diabetes increase the possibility of preservation of some of the endogenous insulin production, which seems to facilitate diabetic control
 the influence of low carbohydrate (cho) diets, starvation, and high cho diets on glucose tolerance tests (gtt) and plasma insulin response of men with chemical diabetes was studied

 [sensitivity to insulin in children and adolescents with susceptibility to diabetes]
 in examining insulin sensitivity in 109 children and adolescents with heredity aggravated by diabetes there was noted a high incidence of various changes up to insulin resistance
 determination of insulin sensitivity should be referred to the methods of the earliest detection of disturbances in the general system of carbohydrate metabolism regulation in persons with heredity aggravated by diabetes
 the use of deliberate receptor sensitivity manipulation may be useful as a treatment for conditions involving disturbances in receptor sensitivity such as tardive dyskinesia and insulin resistant diabetes
 it is one of the characteristic features in diabetes mellitus that insulin response to glucose is low
 nine low insulin responders with normal glucose tolerance in whom prediabetes mellitus should be suspected were found to be included in 104 apparently healthy subjects (9%)
 studies of insulin receptors in people indicate that the insulin receptor is altered in many common disorders such as obesity and diabetes, as well as in rare disorders such as extreme insulin resistance due to circulating antibodies directed at the insulin receptor itself
 since the duration of diabetes was about three times as long in this treatment group and the frequency of metabolic checks twice as great, the raised antibody frequency in insulin-injecting diabetics was attributed to greater exposure to the virus
 the present report describes a patient with insulin-dependent diabetes who developed simultaneously lactic acidosis and ketoacidosis following insulin deprivation
 the effect of insulin treatment on the metabolic response to glucagon in diabetes
 the metabolic response to intravenous glucagon was studied in insulin requiring diabetes before, 1 week and 1 month after treatment with insulin
 a decrease in the ratio of insulin to glucagon in diabetes may account for the changes in protein kinase observed
 glucose control of basal insulin secretion in diabetes
 in a second investigation the plasma insulin concentrations were measured during a gradual reduction of the raised fasting plasma glucose of diabetes to normal levels
 these results do not support the suggestion that stimulated and not basal insulin secretion is impaired in diabetes
6% of them had a pathological insulin response and 5,5% of them showed a known and manifest diabetes mellitus

 we investigated the importance of glucagon in the development of diabetic ketoacidosis by withholding insulin from six patients with juvenile-type diabetes and four totally pancreatectomized subjects
 thus, glucagon is not essential for the development of ketoacidosis in diabetes, as has previously been suggested, but it may accelerate the onset of ketonemia and hyperglycemia in situations of insulin deficiency
 in this group the infants of mothers with strictly controlled diabetes showed lower kt-values, lower insulin peaks and less pronounced cushingoid facies
 the hypothesis is presented (i) that in men who have had a myocardial infarction, an abnormality in glucose tolerance and insulin response and elevation in serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations are all part of the same defect (glucose-insulin-lipid defect), (ii) that this glucose-insulin-lipid defect when glucose intolerance is present is the "mild diabetes" commonly associated with myocardial infarction but is based on a mechanism different from that of classical diabetes, (iii) that this glucose-insulin-lipid defect is secondary to an elevation in e/t, and (iv) that an alteration in the sex hormone milieu is the major predisposing factor for myocardial infarction
 serum mineral changes in dithizone-induced diabetes before and after insulin treatment
 when a diabetes mellitus exists in liver cirrhosis it is to be differed between a diabetes due to absolute or relative insulin deficit and disturbances of carbohydrate clearance which are associated with normal or increased insulin levels
 studies using synthetic somatostatin have provided evidence that glucagon is a physiologically important hormone that exacerbates the consequences of insulin deficiency in human diabetes mellitus
 the ability of somatostatin to diminish both fasting and post-prandial hyperglycemia and to forestall the development of ketoacidosis after withdrawal of insulin in insulin-dependent diabetics suggests a potential therapeutic use of this agent in diabetes
 the high insulin levels may be associated with another metabolic abnormality such as obesity, hypertriglyceridaemia, uraemia or consumption of oral contraceptives, may be inappropriate to the blood sugar levels as in mild diabetes, or may be of exogenous origin as in insulin-treated diabetics
 the oral glucose tolerance test is apposite for the diagnosis of diabetes in view of the impaired insulin response to glucose, but accurate measurement of the basal plasma glucose may be of equal value
 complete suppression of glucagon by insulin in human diabetes
 we conclude that alpha cell hyperfunction in human diabetes can be completely suppressed by insulin administration and is therefore not autonomous, and that the slow rate of fall of blood glucose following insulin administration in diabetics is not secondary to glucagon excess
 in a baby born to a mother who had idiopathic (autoimmune) addison's disease and gestational insulin-dependent diabetes, antibodies to adrenal cortex and to pancreatic islet cells were demonstrated in the cord blood and serum for at least 41 days
 it is suggested that the defective beta-cell response may lead to diminished feedback inhibition of gip secretion by insulin in diabetes mellitus and that the glucagonotropic action of gip may be expressed under these conditions
 in order to explain the increase of total iri frequently observed at basal status, and after glucose administration, in patients with chronic liver disease, plasma proinsulin-like component and insulin levels have been studied in fourteen patients with liver cirrhosis associated or not with clinical or subclinical diabetes mellitus
 a significative increase of plasma insulin was observed at basal status and after a glucose load not only in subjects with clinical or subclinical diabetes but also in those patients without carbohydrate abnormalities
 this increase is apparently not correlated to any clinical characteristic and is associated in fasting and after glucose load with increased proinsulin-like component levels especially in patients with clinical or subclinical diabetes
 the treatment of diabetes may be improved by a more physiological insulin supply and by supplements to the insulin supply
 [hormone treatment in estrogen deficiency can be as natural as insulin in diabetes]
 half of the diabetics were insulin-dependent, and among these labile diabetes with hyperglycemia and high amounts of glucose in the urine was not uncommon

 "essential labile diabetes" is an insulin-dependent diabetes, in the course of which irregular and unpredictable hyperglycemias, frequently with ketosis, and sometimes serious hypoglycemias alternate
 in spite of careful treatment with insulin, diet and suitable hygienic measures, this form of diabetes cannot be influenced
 they are primarily indicated in the labile forms, especially in infantile and juvenile diabetes, in insulin resistance, for high antiinsulin titiers, insulin allergy, lipoatrophy and microangiopathy
 furthermore, accentuation by somatostatin of hyperglycemia, hyperketonemia and hyperaminoacidemia in maturity-onset diabetes argues against its use in patients with residual insulin secretion

 in a prospective study, 64 patients with insulin-dependent juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus were followed for eight to 12 years to determine if those with higher spontaneous intraocular pressures (iops) would be protected from the development of retinopathy
 in one group it was intended that the metabolic signs of diabetes be controlled poorly, and commercial insulin was administered in doses inadequate to prevent chronic, severe hyperglycemia and glucosuria
 the data suggest that the mechanism responsible for diabetic retinopathy is initiated as a result of deficient insulin activity and that the development of the microvascular complications of diabetes are preventable and may be inhibited by careful control of the metabolic disorder

 pathologists have confirmed the specific nature of the insulitis lesion in diabetes requiring insulin
 certain hla histocompatibility antigens are associated with insulin-dependent diabetes and have been interpreted as markers for closely linked immune response genes, a situation that may lead to beta cell susceptibility to viral injury or to uncontrolled beta cell autoaggression following beta cell damage
 however, susceptibility to virus, if it exists in human insulin-requiring diabetes, would appear on clinical grounds to be localized to the pancreas

 interperitoneal isotransplantation of the islets to rats with alloxan diabetes caused an improvement of their condition, normoglycemia, and elevation of the immunoreactive insulin level, and prolonged survival of these rats, in the presence of coarse morphological changes in the endocrine part of the pancreas of the recipient (in 2--4 weeks)
 these results suggest that diabetes and starvation alter the general characteristics of intracellular protein degradation in target tissues of insulin
 obese subjects without diabetes had a twofold greater total plasma insulin response (area under curve) than their counterparts of normal weight, but there was a progressive fall in total plasma insulin response from subjects with mild diabetes (with fasting normoglycaemia) to those with severe diabetes (with fasting hyperglycaemia)
 the early plasma insulin responses of the group with mild diabetes were significantly impaired, and the peak response was only reached at 120 minutes
 the subjects with severe diabetes had a flat insulin response curve
 these data indicate that insulin secretion is reduced in obese blacks with chemical evidence of diabetes and this reduction becomes severe in the symptomatic diabetic
 the results provide grounds to conclude that in sup-sensitive diabetes, the ability of b-cells to synthesize and secrete insulin is being preserved but the sensitivity of glucose receptor versus the signal glucose information was declined
 insulin secretion at different evolutionary phases of diabetes]
 intravenous loading with glucose and glucose+tolbutamid was conduced in five groups of subjects, selected in a way that the intensity of insulin secretion gradually decreases from one group to the other (control group, relatives of patients with diabetes, diabetics sensitive to sup and diabetics resistant to sup)
 with insulin deficiency (in the last three groups) the early insulin secretion (absence of summit in iri curve at the tenth minute), was established to grow weak, whereas in latent diabetes and in sup sensitive diabetics it was preserved and insulinemia was protracted during the second half of the test
 diabetes at a mature age is concluded to be with a changed sensitivity of b-cells, at the beginning, versus glucose as a stimulator with signaling character, but the ability for synthesis and secretion of insulin, in general, is preserved
 with the evolution of diabetes defect, the falling-off of insulin-synthesis ability is included in the pathogenetic mechanisms
 during the first 4 years of diabetes the 24-hour dose/kg body weight increased, indicating a decreasing endogenous insulin production
 we could not explain the cause of the low frequency of secondary diabetic retinopathy in pancreatic diabetes from the results of insulin and glucagon response tests
 group 1 consisted of 230 patients who had neither history of insulin-dependent diabetes nor prior teatment with reserpine or guanethidine

 allergic reactions of the immediate type to insulin are known since its introduction of the treatment of diabetes mellitus
 insulin treatment in diabetes
 the treatment of diabetes is still a problem more than a half-century after the discovery of insulin
 the development of the oral agents was a great public health advance in that many persons with early diabetes, but fearful of insulin injections, had less dread of "the pills" and sought treatment
 techniques have been developed for examining the binding of insulin to its target cells and for evaluating the in vivo action of insulin, rekindling interest in the possible role of insulin resistance in adult-onset diabetes
 we have considered the evidence, first, that the presence of glucagon is essential in the pathogenesis of the full syndrome that results from complete insulin deficiency; second, that in the diabetic in whom insulin levels are relatively fixed, a rise in glucagon concentration contributes to endogenous hyperglycemia; and, third, that conventional methods of treatment of diabetes do not fully correct either the abnormal glucagon levels or the hyperglycemia, but when insulin therapy is supplemented with somatostatin, an agent which suppresses both glucagon and growth hormone, both hyperglycemia and hyperglucagonemia are corrected
 proinsulin and c-peptide in diabetes

 effect of short-term clofibrate on glucose metabolism and insulin secretion in patients with mild maturity-onset diabetes mellitus
 the effect of 1 week clofibrate administration on glucose and insulin responses to oral glucose and to intravenous tolbutamide was evaluated in 21 patients with mild maturity-onset diabetes (fasting plasma glucose 108-152 mg/100 ml)
 the model separates subjects in several classes (normals, chemical diabetes and patent insulin-dependent or independent diabetes) and quantifies treatment efficiency by its effects on blood sugar regulation
 integrated concentrations of glucose and insulin in children with chemical diabetes were normal despite abnormal oral glucose-tolerance tests
 three of four mildly ketoacidotic individuals with newly diagnosed diabetes, who were studied before insulin therapy, had normal growth hormone-integrated concentrations
 the igg fractions from sera a and b, which were obtained from two patients (1 and 2) with insulin-resistant diabetes, inhibited [125i] insulin binding to human adipocytes and, at the same time, stimulated glucose oxidation and inhibited the lipolysis induced by levarterenol in human adipocytes
 these facts suggest that these igg fractions bind to or near the insulin receptor of human adipocytes, that they exhibit their insulin-like effect by binding to the insulin receptor in vitro, and, furthermore, that they are responsible for the extremely insulin-resistant diabetes
 whereas for those (obese) diabetes whose only treatment was dieting--alone or combined with biguanides--hyperinsulinemia attenuates itself as do also variations in glycemia, although some asynchronism remains, in those diabetics treated with sulfonamides--alone or in combination with other treatments--the insulinemia curve is hardly modified

 somatotrophic diabetes: insulin release responses to arginine and glucagon in dogs
 in the somatotrophic diabetes that occurred after 2 days, the hyperinsulinaemia was maintained and the serum iri/glucose (i/g) ratio declined from the early high level but remained elevated
 the traditional "unihormonal abnormality concept," namely, that all of the metabolic derangements of diabetes are the direct consequence of deficient insulin secretion or activity, and the newer so-called bihormonal abnormality hypothesis, proposing that the fullblown diabetic syndrome requires, in addition to the insulin abnormality, a relative glucagon excess, are scrutinized
 the relationship of insulin deficiency to the a-cell malfunction of diabetes, the conflicting evidence concerning the essential role of glucagon in mediating the marked overproduction of glucose and ketones in severe insulin deficiency and the contribution of glucagon to the endogenous hyperglycemia of diabetics without insulin deficiency are examined
 it is concluded that (1) although insulin lowers glucagon levels, restoration to normal of the a-cell dysfunction of diabetes requires that plasma insulin levels vary appropriately with glycemic change; (2) that glucagon mediates the severe endogenous hyperglycemia and hyperketonemia observed in the absence of insulin; (3) that in diabetics in whom insulin is present but relatively fixed an increase in glucagon causes hyperglycemia and glycosuria; and (4) that glucagon suppression could be a potentially useful adjunct to conventional antihyperglycemic treatment of diabetics

 insulin and glucagon have been studied in 20 subjects (both of the subjects' parents were diabetic or in case of only one diabetic parent, the other showed a first degree familiarity of diabetes): 10 showed normal glucose tolerance ('true prediabetics') and 10 impaired glucose tolerance ('genetic chemical diabetes')
 coxsackie b4 viral infection, anti-islet immunity and immunogenetics in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 recent experimental studies of diabetic hyperglycemic men have shown that high-fiber, high-carbohydrate diets cause remission of diabetes mellitus in many men who had been treated previously by oral agents of moderate doses of insulin, but not those who had previously received large amounts of insulin
 in addition, the data suggest that exogenous insulin may indirectly suppress endogenous insulin secretion and thus contribute to the "insulin resistance" of obese patients with maturity-onset diabetes
 these observations suggest that hyperparathyroidism worsens coexisting diabetes mellitus and that one must be aware of increased insulin sensitivity and the possibility of severe hypoglycemia in cases that require insulin after surgical correction of the hypercalcemic state
 infusions of arginine for one hour (1 g/kg/h) into normal ducks, hyperglycaemic normal birds (as a result of glucose infusion: 1 g/kg/h) and diabetic ducks, suggested the persistence of amino acid effect on glucagon secretion, and a slight reduction of the effect on insulin secretion in diabetes
 physical training is also effective against the metabolic complications associated with obesity such as decreased glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinemia and hypertriglyceridemia and should therefore be a method of choice to prevent or treat adult onset diabetes mellitus and endogenous hypertriglyceridemia in obesity
 we report a female small for date neonate, who developed transient diabetes mellitus (tdn) five days after birth and required insulin therapy for five weeks
 lack of a gastrointestinal mediator of insulin action in maturity-onset diabetes

 [the influence of metabolic control on chemotactic activity in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (author's transl)]
 an increased incidence of infections, especially during periods of poor metabolic control is well known in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 therefore, we studied polymorphonuclear chemotaxis and its dependence on the degree of diabetic control in 49 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in 46 controls
 these data indicate that normalization of leucotaxis can be achieved in insulin-dependent diabetes by means of adequate diabetes control

 we conclude that the jejunum plays a more important role in the enteroinsular system than the ileum and that prolonged interruption of this enteroinsular axis can cause insular disorder and what could hypothetically be called enterogenic chemical diabetes, in view of the altered glucose tolerance test and the alteration in insulin secretory response
 streptozotocin diabetes, induced on the 12th day of gestation, or 48 h of fasting did not induce adaptive changes in the activity of placental enzymes while producing a typical insulin deficiency pattern in maternal liver

 effect of acetazolamide on insulin sensitivity in dogs with alloxan diabetes
 microangiopathy of diabetes can be produced by pure insulin-deficiency in human subjects and experimental animals
 present methods of therapy have not been successful in preventing vascular complications in the noninsulin-dependent middle-aged diabetic patient; and, based on the findings of the university group diabetes program, there is reason to believe that new methods of therapy must be realized to improve this outlook
 thus to summarize, there are a number of experimental and critical observations which all tend to support the contention that the hyperglycemia and perhaps to a lesser degree, the insulin deficiency, contribute significantly to the atherosclerosis and more directly initiate and expidite the microangiopathy and neurological abnormalities noted in diabetes
 the metabolism of oleic acid by the perfused rat liver in experimental diabetes induced by antiinsulin serum

 [dynamics of levels of growth hormone and free fatty acids in the blood, and catecholamines in the urine of insulin-resistant and insulin-sensitive diabetes mellitus patients during insulin hypoglycemia]
 the changes in the content of sth and ffa in the blood and of catecholamines in the urine under the effect of insulin hypoglycemia were studied in 28 insulin-sensitive and 40 insulin-resistant patients suffering from diabetes mellitus
 patients with diabetes mellitus who needed 100 or more insulin units per 24 hours for compensation of the affection were referred to the insulin-resistant ones
 this accounts for an increased requirement in exogenous insulin in the insulin-resistant patients with diabetes mellitus
 reduction of the ffa and catecholamine reserves in the insulin-resistant patients suffering from diabetes mellitus is postulated to be one of the main factors in the resistance pathogenesis
 a marked reduction of glucagon on fasting stomach was noted in patients with diabetes mellitus, and a reduction of the hormone concentration 30 and 60 min after the insulin injection
 at the same time there was a significant reduction, and in relatives of diabetes patients also a retardation of glucagon secretion against the background of insulin hypoglycemia

 we conclude that facial flushing after alcohol in people taking chlorpropamide is related to non-insulin-dependent diabetes, especially when there is a strong family history of diabetes, but not to insulin-dependent diabetes
 chlorpropamide-alcohol flushing: a definition of its relation to non-insulin-dependent diabetes
 the single-challenge test for chlorpropamide-alcohol flushing (cpaf) was used to study two groups of patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes and a family history of the disease who were distinguished only by their age at diagnosis (under and over 30)
 this syndrome, which constitutes about one-fifth of all cases of non-insulin-dependent diabetes, may be detected with a single-challenge cpaf test before the onset of glucose intolerance

 association of juvenile diabetes with antigen b8 and b15 was established with the comparison of the phenotype incidence of 28 hla antigens from locus a and b among 1085 healthy control subjects and 200 patients with diabetes mellitus (74 with juvenile insulin-dependent type and 126 with insulin-independent diabetes in adults)
 only the incidence of antigens b15 and bw 21 was established to be increased in the cases of insulin-dependent type of diabetes in adults
 these values correspond better to the altered insulin secretion in maturity-onset diabetes mellitus

 insulin injections or diabetes did not significantly influence the aminoacyl-trna formation catalyzed by aminoacyl-trna synthetases (ars-ases) from intact muscles
 insulin substantially increased (while diabetes decreased) the activity of both enzymes in the denervated muscles
 it is suggested that alrestatin may play a useful role in the therapy of diabetes mellitus since it can augment insulin secretion when glucose is administered to a fasted animal in which the acute insulin response has been shown to be like that of the human diabetic, and in addition, can lower arginine-stimulated glucagon secretion in the animal, the latter being a model of an action that is observed in the human diabetic
 group--aloxanic diabetes rats: treated with 1 unit of nph insulin every day: after the 4th day of aloxane administration, all rats were killed
 group--aloxanic diabetes rats--treated for 5 days with 1 unit of nph insulin every day; after the 5th day until the 7th they were treated with 4 units of nph insulin and were also killed
 in this study, all the animals with aloxanic diabetes were treated with insulin
 then, it is possible that the insulin inhibited the stimulator effect of the diabetes upon the dissacaridases of the small intestine of the rats
 it is suggested that rates of oxidation of lipid fuels may be a major determinant of the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase in tissues in relation to the actions of insulin and lipolytic hormones and the effects of diabetes and starvation
 oral calcium load thus appears to augment glucose-induced insulin secretion only in diabetics, suggesting some abnormality in the mechanism of insulin secretion with reference to calcium in diabetes mellitus

 gastric inhibitory polypeptide in acquired pancreatic diabetes: effects of insulin treatment
 mechanisms of impaired acute insulin release in adult onset diabetes: studies with isoproterenol and secretin
 previous work has suggested that impaired islet glucose recognition occurs in patients with adult onset diabetes, as acute insulin release is absent after iv glucose but present after beta adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol (iso)
 alternatively, there may be heterogeneity in adult onset diabetes, as patients with low responses to all stimuli could have a qualitatively different lesion affecting insulin secretory capacity rather than membrane receptors
 sera of 83 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes of early onset were tested for latex agglutination-inhibiting antibodies to coxsackie virus types b1-b5
 using the trivelli method, we determined hba1c levels in 81 children with overt insulin-dependent diabetes and in 14 healthy children and young adults who served as controls

 a study was made of the effect of administration of maninyl (glybenclamide) into the stomach in a dose of 10 mg/kg of body weight for 7 days on the blood glucose level, insulin and zinc content in the pancreatic islands, and on the "dithizone" diabetes development
 the results do not support the hypothesis of an association between this condition and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 in summary, the effect of insulin treatment of diabetic rats to restore glucose regulation of hepatic glycogen synthase probably involves synthesis of new protein, and the data remain consistent with the hypothesis that the defect may be due to a diabetes-related deficiency in a specific synthase phosphatase and/or alteration of the synthase molecule itself
 acarbose diminished the postprandial increases in blood glucose, lactate, and pyruvate concentrations and may therefore be of value in the management of insulin-dependent diabetes

 the responses over a period of 120 min to an infusion and wash out of insulin show some transient as well as steady state differences with age, obesity, or diabetes
 the decrease in t/p seen with obesity and with maturity-onset diabetes cannot be accounted for solely by changes in fasting plasma insulin levels in these populations
 finally, the changes in the metabolism of insulin are not large, making it unlikely that they are the sole cause of the major alterations in glucose tolerance seen with aging, obesity, or diabetes

 twenty-two patients, whose initial oral glucose tolerance test (ogtt) was not diabetic, but who possibly had predisposition for diabetes, underwent iterative ogtt with plasma insulin determination and estimate of insulin-secretion capacity (plasma insulin area/blood glucose area ratio, and insulin-secretion coefficient)
 thus, it seems possible to select subjects most prone to future diabetes with simple parameters estimating insulin-secretion capacity during ogtt

 seven patients with juvenile-onset, insulin-dependent diabetes (aged 13 to 32 years) were continuously treated for 12 to 32 weeks while out of the hospital in their usual environment with a portable, battery-powered infusion pump which delivers insulin subcutaneously in basal (between-meal) doses with pulse dose increments before meals
 we conclude that normalization or near normalization of blood glucose levels can be achieved with a portable subcutaneous insulin infusion system when continuously used to treat patients with juvenile-onset, insulin-dependent diabetes outside the hospital for three to eight months

 this study aimed at evaluating the effect of acetylsalicylic acid (asa) on blood glucose, plasma ffa, glycerol, 3-hydroxybutyrate, alanine, c-peptide, glucagon and growth hormone responses to arginine in subjects with insulin-dependent diabetes
 these metabolic effects exerted by asa in insulin-dependent diabetes seem not to be related to alterations in endogenously secreted insulin since c-peptide circulating levels were similar during the pre- and post-treatment arginine tests

 rational approaches to the therapy of patients with insulin-independent diabetes should be based on correcting the underlying defects
 the major metabolic abnormalities present in patients with insulin-independent diabetes are: (1) impaired insulin action, (2) defective glucose-mediated insulin secretion, and (3) hyperglucagonemia
 individual patients with insulin-independent diabetes have varying degrees of insulin resistance or impaired glucose-mediated insulin secretion

 free insulin, c-peptide and glucagon profiles in insulin dependent diabetes mellitus
 we believe that the study of insulin receptor in lymphocyte's dog is important to understand some aspects of pathological states in diabetes
 induction of diabetes with streptozotocin produced regression of lesions classified as insulin dependent; lesions that continued to grow in diabetic rats were classified as insulin independent
 we conclude that (a) cessation of tumor growth after induction of diabetes resulted in reduction of er levels, (b) treatment with insulin that resulted in an altered tumor growth was accompanied by elevated er levels, and (c) insulin may play a role in regulation of er independent of tumor growth
 multivariate analysis revealed that in both male and female diabetic patients treated with insulin, diabetes was a highly significant influence on serum hdl cholesterol concentration, but in the non-insulin-treated diabetic patients the influence was absent in women and only marginal in men

 non-insulin-dependent diabetes is common on guam; insulin-dependent diabetes is rare
 these circumstances could result in the number of persons aged 45 yr and over increasing disproportionately in the future, increasing dramatically the number of persons at risk to develop non-insulin-dependent diabetes
 hyperinsulinism complicating control of diabetes mellitus by an artificial beta-cell
 control of insulin-dependent diabetes with portable miniaturized infusion systems
 a method of insulin therapy that appears to achieve better control of diabetes than present conventional methods is the use of insulin infusion devices--either glucose-controlled feedback (closed-loop) systems or the preprogrammed (open-loop) infusion pump
 a 16-yr prospective study of 615 gestational diabetic subjects, half of whom were randomly assigned to insulin therapy during pregnancy, is evaluated to report on the potential reduction in subsequent diabetes due to insulin therapy
 in the subsets of women managed with insulin who bore a baby of large birthweight or who had a family history of diabetes, subsequent decompensated diabetes was found to be significantly reduced
 the finding suggests the possibility of long-term preventive benefits from insulin treatment in high risk subsets of women with gestational diabetes
 these results suggest that an abrupt deprivation of insulin from islets results in an elevation of pancreatic somatostatin concentration, and that glucagon in the pancreas plays a minor role in determining pancreatic somatostatin concentration in rats with insulin-deprived diabetes of short duration
 the insulin response to glucose infusion in gestational diabetes
 the findings in this study support the hypothesis that gestational diabetes may arise in women who are unable to achieve adequate insulinogenic compensation to pregnancy
 increased insulin sensitivity in gestational diabetes may be a compensatory mechanism
 thus, an interesting feature of expression of the diabetes gene in the 129/j strain is the persisting hyperglucagonaemia in the face of moderating hyperinsulinaemia
 monolayer cell cultures from pancreatic islets of aging 129/j strain diabetes (db3j/db3j) and lean littermate control mice were tested for differences in glucagon and insulin secretion in either serum-free eagle's minimal essential medium (mem) or dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (dmem)
 twenty-seven of these patients had diabetes, sixteen of them requiring insulin
 residual beta cell function in insulin-dependent diabetes: evaluation by circadian determination of c-peptide immunoreactivity

 the diabetes-induced decrease in heart rate was reversed within 4 days after the institution of insulin-treatment, which also prevented the fall in blood pressure
 insulin-treatment reversed the effects of diabetes on theophylline-induced relaxation of the kc1, but not the phenylephrine contracture
 these findings indicate that insulin-treatment will either prevent or reverse diabetes-induced decreases in blood pressure, heart rate and vascular responsiveness to phenylephrine and ck1
 long-term diabetes caused no further reduction in rna, but resulted in the development of an additional impairment to protein synthesis that also affected the soleus and that was not corrected by perfusion with insulin

 a series of 57 diabetics underwent standard electroretinographic recordings for the purpose of testing the effect of insulin on the electroretinograms in diabetes mellitus, specifically on the oscillatory potential changes (kozak et al
 perhaps the most important advance in the past 10 years is proof that insulin dependent diabetes is genetically different from the insulin independent form
 most progress has been made in unraveling the etiology of insulin dependent diabetes, although more information is needed before the mode of inheritance is finally settled
 the last few years have produced a plethora of new facts about insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, providing geneticists, clinicians, and epidemiologists with the fascinating challenge of a disease with an apparently genetic susceptibility to external (environmental) triggers
 little progress has been made in the field of insulin independent diabetes, and one might safely predict that the diabetic syndrome will still produce some nightmares for researchers who take up the challenge of trying to unravel its various etiologies and methods of inheritance

 autonomic neuropathy in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in the young
 twenty-five cases of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in the young were investigated for autonomic dysfunction by simple electrophysiological tests to assess the integrity of the cardiovascular reflexes
 this study demonstrates that subclinical autonomic neuropathy is not an uncommon occurrence in cases of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in the young and emphasizes the need for a greater awareness of this complication
 the following indications must be observed in prescribing ovulation preventatives:  1) use the lowest possible dose of estrogen and gestagen; 2) observe the contraindications at age 30-35 when the risk is very great, and use alternative methods when possible after age 40; 3) check every 6 months to 1 year during the office visit; 4) observe the absolute contraindications (thromboses, embolisms, blood vessel damage, hypertony, hormone-dependent tumors, insulin-dependent diabetes, abnormal genital bleeding); 5) observe the relative contraindications (gynecological age less than 2 years, menstruation less than 1 year, amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, venous thrombosis of the legs, certain cardiac diseases, acute jaundice, jaundice of pregnancy, certain bilirubin disturbances, depression, migraine headaches, epilepsy, and others); 6) discontinue use of the contraceptive upon appearance of thromboembolisms, hypertony, disturbances of vision, longterm immobilization of the patient (e

 in diabetes of varying severity, serum insulin and sm levels showed highly significant association up to the insulin concentration (18 microu/ml) corresponding to normal serum sm (1 u/ml)
 emphasis is given to the clinical association of diabetes with other autoimmune disease; the increased incidence of organ-specific autoimmunity in diabetic patients; the occurrence of humoral and cell-mediated antipancreas (islet) autoimmunity in diabetes; the association of hla with juvenile-onset, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and with certain specific subpopulations of diabetic patients; the possible role of viruses in the etiology of diabetes; and the occurrence of alterations in humoral and cell-mediated immunity, granulocyte function, and the host defense against infectious agents in human diabetics and in animals with experimental diabetes

 of the 75 insulin-dependent diabetics 45% had severe diabetes (white classes d-f); nevertheless, perinatal mortality was only 5
 the most important forms of diabetes mellitus are the juvenile onset diabetes (jod) with primary lack of insulinsecretion and the maturity onset diabetes (mod) with a progressive lack of insulinsecretion
 in the higher age groups one can also find diabetesforms, which need high daily insulin doses, such as cases with insulin-antibodies, with insulin antagonistic hormons and with insulin allergy
 another form of diabetes mellitus in the old age group needing high daily amounts of insulin is due to the reduction of insulin receptors in the peripheric cells
 this picture is specific and diagnostic for the classical insulin-dependent type of diabetes, which occurs more often in young individuals
 this pathological picture is associated with the classical insulin-independent, maturity-onset type of diabetes
 in contrast, the mean values in mothers with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus continue to rise
 a prospective study was therefore carried out over eight months to determine the incidence of hypoglycaemic episodes in 50 insulin-treated diabetics taking beta-blockers, as compared with 100 diabetic controls matched for age, sex, and duration of diabetes

 our results indicate that plasma cr3+ behavior does not reflect impairment of glucose tolerance and insulin secretion in diabetes mellitus
 isoproterenol-stimulated c-peptide and insulin secretion in diabetic and nonobese normal subjects: decreased hepatic extraction of endogenous insulin in diabetes
 erythrocyte insulin binding in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus: lack of relationship to duration and control of diabetes in children and adolescents
 insulin binding was measured in the erythrocytes (rbcs) of four children and 12 adolescents with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in the basal (fasting, nonketotic) state
 children and adolescents with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus showed normal binding of insulin to their rbcs when expressed as the total insulin bound over the physiologic range of insulin concentrations
 these parameters of insulin binding were not correlated with either the duration of diabetes or the degree of diabetic control in the patients
 since insulin binding by erythrocytes has been shown to reflect binding by traditional target tissues (liver, fat), the data suggest that alterations in binding of insulin to cells in children and adolescents with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus probably play little, if any, role in the response of these patients to exogenous insulin or in the control of their glucose metabolism in the basal state
 exogenous glucagon was given in order to reproduce the metabolic conditions of insulin-deficient diabetes mellitus

 enhanced gip secretion, participates in the development of the hyperinsulinaemia of obesity and maturity onset diabetes mellitus
 investigation of mechanisms responsible for the decreased numbers of insulin receptors observed in obesity and diabetes has been facilitated by the development of cell culture systems permitting study of cellular events independent of fluctuating hormone levels and multiple endocrine interactions present in the whole organism
 this difference is maintained in culture over many generations, suggesting that the decreased expression of insulin receptors in these cells is related to the genetic trait for diabetes

 contractures induced by 10(-4)m phenylephrine (pe) and 70 mm kcl and their relaxation by 10(-2) m theophylline (theo) were observed in aortae isolated from untreated and insulin-treated streptozotocin-diabetic rats for 12 weeks after the induction of diabetes
5 units (u) of neutral protamine hagedorn (nph) insulin/day/partially prevented diabetes-induced decreases in the pe contractures while completely preventing them in the k-contractures
 relaxation of the pe-contracture, which was more susceptible to theo than was the k-contracture in control tissues, was not affected by either untreated or insulin-treated diabetes until 12 weeks after the induction of diabetes
 while in vivo insulin treatment did not reverse diabetes-induced decreases in the theo-induced relaxation of the pe contracture, it did prevent the diabetes-induced increase in the relaxation of the k-contracture which was observed after 4 weeks
 the results indicate that while the mechanisms involved in mediating the pe and k-contractures are inhibited by diabetes, insulin is more effective at preventing the effects of diabetes on the k-contracture and its relaxation than on the induction and relaxation of the pe-contracture

 [changes in glucose metabolism and endocrine function in the remnant pancreas after major pancreatectomy, with special reference to the function of the anti-insulin system in sandmeyer's diabetes (author's transl)]
 immediately after the removal of 90 per cent or more of the pancreas, diabetes developed, and the function of the anti-insulin system was depressed, showing a poor response of glucagon secretion to hypoglycemia after insulin load and degeneration or destruction of the islet cells and both a and b cells, and the dosage of insulin required to control blood sugar was close to that of a total pancreatectomy
 6 to 24 weeks after the removal of 70 to 90 per cent of the pancreas, so-called sandmeyer's diabetes occurred, in which glucose tolerance and the function of the anti-insulin system were within the normal range during the early postoperative periods, but the function of the anti-insulin system was highly activated later, showing a high response of pancreatic glucagon secretion to hypoglycemia after insulin load, accompanied by degeneration of b cells, but not a cells
 these results could well explain the fact that the insulin dosage needed to control blood sugar in sandmeyer's diabetes was 3 to 4 times more than it was in total pancreatectomy
 after the removal of 70 per cent or less of the pancreas, diabetes did not occur, and glucose tolerance and the function of the anti-insulin system were maintained well, without any significant change in the islets of the remnant pancreas
 insulin therapy relieved the disturbed function of the anti-insulin system in diabetes following pancreatectomy

 experimental diabetes caused a significant depression in lung glucose oxidation rate which was normalized by exogenous insulin therapy
 diabetes also depressed the rate of amino acid incorporation into lung protein; in vitro, insulin stimulated synthesis of selective protein species by the diabetic lung
 these results, together with the demonstration of pulmonary receptor sites for insulin and the observation that diabetes selectively affects the ultrastructure of only two cell types in the lung, suggest that insulin may be an important regulator of lung function

 these results may contribute to the understanding of the propensity for infection in patients with insulin dependent diabetes
 the advent of a successful long-term pancreatic transplant or a reliable miniaturized artificial pancreas may, soon, supercede it as a treatment modality, but for the time it would appear that home glucose monitoring is a viable alternative to the more conventional and less successful methods of control and should at least be considered for use in patients with insulin-deficient diabetes mellitus
 personal experience for many years of having insulin dependent diabetes has proven the benefit of physical exercise
 physical exercise is considered to be one of the basic principles in the management of diabetes, but the evidence to support the long-term benefit of exercise in insulin dependent diabetes is limited

 in the control of insulin dependent diabetes in a remission, hemoglobin a1c allowed assessment of the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism after suppression of insulin therapy
 parallel dysfunctions of pancreatic a, b and pp cells in insulin dependent diabetes
 to test the possibility that insulitis might play an etiological role in the pathogenesis of insulin dependent diabetes, functions of 3 kinds of islet constituting cells (a, b and pp cells) were estimated by quantifying secretory responses of glucagon-, c-peptide-and pancreatic polypeptide-producing cells to hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia
 in insulin dependent diabetes, all 3 hormonal responses were severely impaired to the same extent
 these results suggest that a, b, and pp cells of islet of langerhans are evenly destroyed in parallel fashion at least in insulin dependent diabetes and in some insulin independent diabetes, suggesting insulitis as a possible cause of these types of diabetes
 medical evaluation disclosed an insulin tolerance test diagnostic of diabetes, although a glucose tolerance test was not markedly abnormal
 in the case of streptosotocin diabetes (simulated hypoinsulinism) no correlation between insulin binding and its biological effects was observed, which can be accounted for by disturbances in transmission of the signal from the insulin--receptor complex to the enzymatic systems of the cells

 in juvenile-onset, insulin-dependent diabetes, the pancreatic islets show severe and pathognomonic changes
 these findings may well account for the abnormal secretory behavior of the glucagon-secreting a cells in insulin-dependent juvenile-onset diabetes
 in maturity-onset, noninsulin-dependent diabetes, the pancreatic pathology is extremely variable and not pathognomonic
 genetic heterogeneity is now considered to be firmly established by family, twin, metabolic, immunologic and hla disease association studies that separate idiopathic diabetes into insulin-dependent types (juvenile-onset type) and noninsulin-dependent types (maturity-onset type)
 further heterogeneity is being demonstrated within each of these broad groups of disorders--within insulin-dependent diabetes using the hla antigens and immunologic studies, and within noninsulin-dependent diabetes using such criteria as obesity, insulin response, age of onset and chlorpropamide-primed alcohol-induced flushing
 autoimmunity in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 genetic susceptibility, environmental factors and immune mechanisms are implicated in the pathogenesis and etiology of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus

 severely brittle diabetes is defined as a rare subtype of insulin-dependent diabetes with wide, fast, unpredictable, and inexplicable swings in blood glucose concentration, often culminating in ketoacidosis or hypoglycaemic coma
 six patients with non-brittle diabetes were also treated by continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion
 the remaining patient with brittle diabetes, previously safely controlled only with continuous intravenous insulin, did not respond to continuous intramuscular infusion
 it is concluded that in five of the six patients with brittle diabetes studied here impaired or irregular absorption of insulin from the subcutaneous site played a more important part in their hyperlability than inappropriate injection strategies
 heterogeneity of the insulin-receptor interaction in lipoatropic diabetes
 [125] insulin binding to its receptors was studied on circulating cells from 11 patients (8 females and 3 males) with lipoatropic diabetes
 these data suggest that the pathogenesis of the insulin resistance in lipoatropic diabetes is heterogeneous and may involve both receptor and postreceptor abnormalities
23 kg) was lower than that of nine infants of mothers with gestational diabetes not receiving insulin or intensive efforts at maintenance of normoglycemia (3
 we conclude that the strict control of maternal diabetes during the last trimester of pregnancy prevents fetal hyperinsulinemia and is associated with the development of normal numbers of insulin receptors on the infants' monocytes
 we have found complement-dependent cytotoxic antibodies in the serum of 8 of 24 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus using a 51cr cytotoxicity assay with monolayers of cloned rat islet cells (clones rinm 5f and rinm 14b)
 in contrast, complement-dependent cytotoxicity with 51cr release greater than 24% was found with sera from 34 controls or from 5 patients with polyglandular failure without diabetes, and was present in only 1 serum our of 12 from patients with insulin-independent diabetes mellitus
 the prevalence of antibodies appears to decrease with duration of insulin-dependent diabetes, and in one patient studied, cytotoxic antibodies were present at the time of diagnosis of diabetes

 type i (insulin dependent) diabetes mellitus
 is there strong evidence for a non-hla linked gene? a recent investigation of families containing two and three consecutive generations affected with type i (insulin dependent) diabetes mellitus has led to speculation that there is a second susceptibility gene, not linked to the major histocompatibility complex

 in the present experiment, changes in carbohydrate and insulin metabolism and glucagon secretion were studied in dogs in order to elucidate the pathophysiology in diabetes after major resection of the pancreas
 immediately after resection of 90% or more of the entire pancreas, diabetes occurred with absolute insulin deficiency, being accompanied by decreased function of the anti-insulin system with poor secretion of glucagon and delayed recovery of blood sugar after the insulin load
 six weeks or more after resection of 70 to 90% of the entire pancreas, so-called sandmeyer's diabetes gradually as a consequence of a decrease in insulin secretion and an increase in glucagon secretion from the remnant pancreas
 these results could well explain the fact that the insulin dosage required to control blood sugar in sandmeyer's diabetes was 3 to 4 times more than that needed after total pancreatectomy

 growth-onset (type i) diabetes stems from primary beta-cell failure; in these patients insulin sensitivity is normal, and the number of insulin receptors on target cells is normal
 adult-onset (type ii) diabetes represents a combination of relative insulin deficiency (impaired early response to glycemic stimulus with subsequent hyperinsulinemia, at first) and peripheral insulin resistance, both of which engender 24 hr hyperinsulinemia that secondarily reduces insulin receptor concentrations

 the prevalence and features of diabetic retinopathy have been examined in 95 pairs of identical twins, 31 concordant for insulin-dependent diabetes (idd), 27 discordant for idd, and 37 concordant for non-insulin-dependent diabetes (nidd)
 however, in insulin-dependent diabetic pairs the situation was quite different; only 21 of 31 pairs were in the same retinopathy category, and of the 10 pairs of co-twins with the same duration of diabetes 5 pairs showed a striking difference for retinopathy
 we conclude that genetic factors may be important in the etiology of retinopathy in non-insulin-dependent diabetes but that nongenetic factors must be important in the pathogenesis of retinopathy in insulin-dependent diabetes
 diabetes mellitus appeared later, requiring insulin therapy in the three of them who survived more than a few weeks
 these high, nonsuppressible, nonstimulable insulin levels and the sequence of hypoglycemia followed by insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is consistent with the hypothesis of a selective toxicity turned towards the b-cells
 it is suggested that pentamidine can induce hypoglycemia because of an early cytolytic release of insulin, and then diabetes mellitus because of b-cell destruction and insulin deficiency

 insulin treatment of the pregnant rats restored the biosynthesis of phosphatidyl choline and lysophosphatidyl choline towards normal on gestational day 20, while the ratio of phosphatidyl glycerol to phosphatidyl inositol incorporation of 14c-glucose was decreased, suggesting that the biosynthesis of phosphatidyl glycerol is more sensitive than that of phosphatidyl choline and lysophosphatidyl choline to the metabolic disturbances inherent in maternal diabetes
 novel laboratory techniques such as the determination of proinsulin, insulin, c-peptide and insulin receptors have allowed further subclassification of diabetes mellitus today as representing a symptom rather than a disease
 insulin treatment reverses the postreceptor defect in adipocyte 3-o-methylglucose transport in type ii diabetes mellitus
 the insulin resistance of type ii diabetes mellitus is due to both receptor and postreceptor defects of in vivo insulin action, with the postreceptor defect being the predominant abnormality
 recent studies have shown that the in vivo postreceptor defect initially present in patients with type ii diabetes is significantly reversed by insulin therapy
 these studies demonstrated that the decrease in adipocyte glucose transport activity in type ii diabetes is practically reversible by intensive insulin therapy
 this closely corresponds to the reversal by insulin therapy of the postreceptor defect expressed in vivo and provides further evidence that a cellular cause of the postreceptor defect in type ii diabetes is a decrease in glucose transport system activity in the major insulin target tissues
 as gip is known to potentiate glucose-induced insulin secretion and possibly the biosynthesis of insulin, the low ir-gip responses in subjects with type i diabetes may significantly influence insulin levels and hyperglycemia
 experimental diabetes was induced in the bovine in two experiments by intravenous injection of alloxan (110 mg/kg or 60 mg/kg) in order to determine the role of insulin on nitrogen and amino acid metabolism

 alterations of peripheral t-lymphocyte subpopulations in patients with insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes mellitus
 subpopulations of peripheral t-lymphocytes were studied in two groups of patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm): eleven newly diagnosed diabetics and twenty-one patients having diabetes of long duration (13 +/- 1 yr)
 this study demonstrates that insulin-filled osmotic minipumps provide no advantage over daily insulin injection in the long term control of diabetes
 a prospective, stratified, randomized 3-year clinical trial was conducted on the effect of rigorous versus conventional glucose control on peripheral nerve function in 33 insulin-treated diabetic patients with a duration of diabetes of less than 2 years

 calcium-atpase activities were significantly higher than control activities after 2 weeks of untreated stz-diabetes and in tissues from all rats that received insulin treatment which was instituted after 1, 2 and 3 weeks of stz-diabetes
 viruses may be etiologic agents for non-insulin-dependent (type ii) diabetes
 although diabetes mellitus is generally subclassified into either of two categories, insulin-dependent (type i) and non-insulin-dependent (type ii), the heterogeneity of its clinical expressions, genetics, and etiologies may make a clear distinction in classification difficult
 however, clinical data derived from the subtle chronicity of type ii diabetes, the lack of pathological alterations in the pancreas in some patients with type ii diabetes, and animal and human studies with venezuelan encephalitis virus and rubella virus suggest a possible role for viruses in the pathogenesis of non-insulin-dependent diabetes
 the phytohaemagglutinin response and lymphocyte subpopulations in young blacks and indians with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 data on ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis and dermatitis herpetiformis are very close to expectations for an additive (or dominant) mode of inheritance for the hla-linked disease-predisposing gene, and data on hemochromatosis, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and celiac disease are close to recessive expectations
 dr data for insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm) strongly indicate that there are two separate "disease" alleles, which exhibit negative complementation, predisposing individuals to iddm, where the mode of inheritance of the "disease" alleles considered separately is close to recessive
 in a material of 3596 oral glucose tolerance tests (ogtt) performed in a population investigation of middle-aged males in malmö, fasting and 120 min values of blood glucose and plasma insulin immunoreactivity (iri) were studied while taking factors like body weight, smoking, alcohol, gastric resection and selfreported diabetes heredity into account

 changes in high density lipoprotein cholesterol after initiation of insulin therapy in non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus: relationship to changes in body weight
 thus, insulin therapy of diabetes mellitus favorably affects hdl-c concentration perhaps by altering triglyceride metabolism and represents a unique situation where increases in body weight are associated with increases in serum hdl-c concentration
 overt diabetes is probably a later event, occurring when sufficient damage to pancreatic cells has occurred and appropriate hyperinsulinaemia cannot be sustained
 clinical, morphological, and biochemical findings reported in the spontaneously diabetic bb-wistar rat strongly indicate that this animal may be a true model of human insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 these data suggest that insulin treatment of alloxan diabetes results in axonal degeneration which closely resembles findings in human diabetic neuropathies
 since virtually all insulin-dependent diabetic patients receive daily administration of insulin, the possibility that peripheral neuropathies may in part result from the insulin treatment requires more extensive investigation in a variety of animal models to separate the neuropathic effects of diabetes from the neuropathic effects of insulin therapy

 the usefulness of human insulin (novo) in the treatment of diabetes was studied in eight insulin-dependent diabetic patients
 thus, the differences between the absorption of human insulin and porcine regular insulin from a subcutaneous depot as observed in the pharmacokinetic studies in normal man do not appear to be relevant in the clinical practice of the subcutaneous insulin replacement therapy in type i diabetes mellitus at near-normoglycemia

 alterations of maternal metabolism in normal and diabetic pregnancies: differences in insulin-dependent, non-insulin-dependent, and gestational diabetes
 pregnant women with carbohydrate intolerance represent three metabolically heterogeneous groups: type i (insulin-dependent), type ii (non-insulin-dependent), and gestational diabetes
 patients with type i diabetes are at risk for ketosis and require replacement therapy because of a deficient production of insulin
 in gestational diabetes, the metabolic stress of pregnancy evokes reversible hyperglycemia which may be associated with either a surfeit or a deficiency of insulin
 this effect was found only when transplantation of the insulin-producing tumor occurred within 2-4 weeks of the induction of diabetes
 the effects of insulin and thyroid hormone treatments on cardiac sarcoplasmic reticular function were investigated in chronic streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats
 the results of this study provide some evidence that the depression in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticular calcium accumulation during diabetes is a consequence of insulin deficiency and associated chronic metabolic changes but the hypothyroid condition that accompanies experimental diabetes does not appear to play any role in this defect

 [pathogenesis and immunotherapy of insulin-dependent (type i) diabetes mellitus]
 the association of insulin-dependent (type i) diabetes mellitus with hla-dr3 and dr4 and with several epidemiological, virological, immunological, and clinical data suggests a heterogenous pathogenesis
 it is only rarely that insulin-dependent diabetes results from a pure viral infection or as part of polyendocrine autoimmune deficiencies
 the spontaneous diabetes of the bb wistar rat has many homologies to that of human insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm)
 it is proposed that this hypothesis be tested in the most well-defined animal model for human insulin deficiency diabetes currently available--the bb diabetic rat
 in a search for an appropriate animal model, we have studied platelet function and the properties of platelet cyclic ncl-pde in rats with streptozocin-induced diabetes, spontaneous diabetes, and human insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm)
 cryopreservation of bb rat embryos would ensure perpetuation, at greatly reduced cost, of this model of nonobese, insulin-dependent, juvenile-onset diabetes in man
 our results showed that in the severely insulin deficient bb wistar rat (1) pancreatic concentrations of sli, glucagon, and insulin were reduced; (2) the b cells are virtually eliminated and the d cells severely reduced early in diabetes; a and pp cells are resistant initially but eventually sustain major losses as observed in terminal islets; (3) retinal sli is reduced, but sli in gut and brain appears unchanged; (4) the secretion of sli, glucagon, and insulin from the perfused pancreas is diminished 60%, 36%, and 99%, respectively; (5) pv and ivc blood levels of sli and glucagon are elevated despite decreased pancreatic secretion; (6) the trans-hepatic gradient of sli is reduced; and (7) insulin treatment normalizes the elevated pv and ivc levels of sli and glucagon
 the more common, designated unstable diabetes, is severe and lethal unless treated with insulin
 less commonly, a stable type of diabetes mellitus ensues for which insulin therapy is not mandatory
 unstable diabetic rats demonstrate a reduction in the concentration of pancreatic immunoreactive glucagon and somatostatin, suggesting that alpha and delta cells also sustain injury in this model of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 use of supplementary nomenclature to indicate bb rat lines of high and low incidence or to refer to different stages of the syndrome (potential diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, overt insulin-dependent diabetes) should remain the discretion of the individual breeder, but should be rigorously defined

 [changes in fatty tissue sensitivity to insulin in the process of diabetes mellitus compensation using sulfanilurea derivatives]
 during incubation of an isolated adipose tissue, obtained by surgical biopsy from the left inguinal region, it was shown that insulin in concentrations of 50 and 100 microu/ml does not stimulate glucose-14c inclusion into the tissue lipids in patients with decompensated diabetes mellitus in contrast to that of healthy humans
 insulin effect on the lipid synthesis is restored up to the normal level after diabetes mellitus compensation by means of sulfaniluria derivatives
 insulin role in regulating the immunocompetent tissue structure was studied on experimental rats with alloxan diabetes
 it also showed that in patients with hypoglycemia, the values of c-protein, and after intravenous injection of tolbutamide, were good predictive factors for insulin-dependance: all patients with basal c-protein less than 1,9 ng/ml could not be stabilised without insulin; when the basal c-protein greater than or equal to 1,9 ng/ml and the amplitude of response at the 5th min was greater than or equal to 0,4 ng/ml, the diabetes could be stabilised by diet and oral hypoglycemic agents in 90 p
 [acquired remissions of insulin dependence in recent diabetes mellitus

 in insulin dependent diabetes, lack of adipose tissue lpl stimulation augments triglycerid-rich lipoproteins, by slowing their catabolism, resulting in a weak increase of ldl and a lowering of hdl
 in non insulin dependent diabetes with hyperinsulinism, vldl are elevated because of insulin stimulation of triglycerid hepatic production
 hla system in chinese children with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 hla in 12 unrelated chinese paediatric patients with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm) were found to have an increased frequency of bw22, b17 and aw33

 metformin reduces insulin requirement in type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes
 the effect of metformin on type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes has been assessed with the artificial pancreas
 these results show that insulin receptor binding is diminished in type 1 diabetes, perhaps as a consequence of higher peripheral blood insulin levels and that metformin can improve binding, and so reduce the amount of insulin needed to reach euglycaemia

 the weight loss responded to adequate control of the diabetes with insulin and was followed by improvement in the neuropathy
 moreover, this model predicts that in hypoinsulinaemic states, such as diabetes and fasting, intracellular ph and intracellular atp levels would be depressed
 these findings suggest that some of the immune complexes detected in randomly selected diabetics are related to insulin treatment, reflecting either differences in the type of diabetes or the effects of heterologous insulin

 oral contraceptives have a more limited use in insulin-independent overt or chemical diabetes
 some patients may need total pancreatectomy which leads to permanent insulin-dependent diabetes in most of them
 the inhibition of pgi2 production by insulin in isolated rat adipocytes supports the view that the elevated plasma level of 6-keto-pgf1 alpha in rats with non-ketotic diabetes mellitus and diabetic ketoacidosis is derived at least in part from production of pgi2 by the adipocyte cell mass
 [results of a population study of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus in childhood and adolescence]
 in this study in 285 patients hospitalized in a department of internal medicine for acute or chronic conditions, serum zinc assays have shown the following results: serum zinc concentrations are significantly decreased in acute critical conditions (cardiovascular ischemic disorders, heart failure, infections); in chronic conditions, serum zinc is decreased in some instances (renal failure, cancer, alcoholism, diarrhea), while it remains normal in others (compensated heart failure, non-insulin dependent diabetes, arterial hypertension, obesity)
 in order to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of two methods of blood glucose self-monitoring (either direct semi-quantitative reading on haemoglukotest 20-800 or quantitative reading of dextrostix strips using a reflectance-meter, glucometer) 20 insulin-dependent diabetics selected according to the quality of the management of their own diabetes were asked to try both methods for 3 months and then fill a questionnaire assessing their acceptance
 other immunological mechanisms are incriminated in the development of insulin resistance during exogenous insulin treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus
 resistance to endogenous insulin which characterises type 2 diabetes mellitus is related to a decrease in number and density of peripheral insulin receptors

 insulin resistance is evident in several clinical conditions such as obesity, diabetes type ii, hypercortisolism
 the doses of ultralente and soluble insulin needed for different severities of diabetes and degrees of insulin resistance can be predicted

 no significant differences between theo-induced relaxation of the pe-contracture in control, untreated diabetic and insulin-treated diabetic aortas were observed until 12 weeks after the induction of diabetes
 this diabetes-induced decrease in relaxation of the pe-contracture was not reversed by insulin-treatment
 this diabetes-induced increase in the theo-induced relaxation of the k-contracture was reversed by insulin-treatment
 these results indicate that diabetes affects the ability of the vascular smooth muscle to relax in response to theophylline, depending on the length of time in the diabetic state, the type of stimulus (pe or kcl) and whether or not insulin-treatment is applied

 analysis of the insulin gene in noninsulin-dependent diabetes
 that diabetes is a metabolic disorder characterized by insulin deficiency is well known
 the results of these studies suggest that the insulin-secretory defect in diabetes may be secondary to impaired synthesis
 impaired glucose tolerance, noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and obesity are common clinical disorders associated with significant insulin resistance
 cellular alterations responsible for insulin resistance in obesity and type ii diabetes mellitus
 numerous studies in animals and man have demonstrated that insulin resistance is a prominent feature in both obesity and type ii diabetes mellitus
 recent evidence demonstrates that improving blood sugar levels by conventional means at least partially corrects both the insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency of type ii diabetes mellitus
 role of environmental factors in the development of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 environmental factors, such as excessive caloric intake leading to obesity, altered dietary composition, physical inactivity, various forms of stress, hormonal imbalance, drugs, toxins, and the process of aging, may contribute to the development of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in the genetically predisposed subject but do not by themselves cause the disease
 both abnormal pancreatic beta-cell function and decreased sensitivity to insulin are present in most patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and the degree of carbohydrate intolerance is dependent on the interaction between these two factors
 efforts to prevent or treat noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus should be aimed primarily towards eliminating factors associated with the development of insulin resistance and promoting those that increase insulin sensitivity
 glipizide, a second-generation sulfonylurea, has potent antidiabetic actions in patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 the effects of glipizide treatment on insulin sensitivity, glucose-mediated insulin secretion, and glucose utilization were measured in newly diagnosed or untreated patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 this is a brief summary of the extensive clinical experience with glipizide in the treatment of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 among its other qualities, it has been shown (1) to stimulate insulin action through extrapancreatic effects that affect insulin-receptor binding and enhance tissue responsiveness to insulin; (2) to favorably influence the principal pathophysiologic abnormalities, defective secretory dynamics, and target-cell resistance to insulin observed in noninsulin-dependent diabetes; (3) to improve control of blood glucose, and when used in conjunction with insulin, to achieve glycemic control with reductions in insulin dosage; (4) to lower the level of plasma glucose and to maintain this effect despite a short half-life; (5) to stimulate insulin secretion following its oral administration; (6) to be more effective than tolbutamide in elderly patients with long-standing diabetes; and (7) to be well tolerated with few side effects
 these factors seem to recommend its use for the management of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 our observations show that glipizide therapy is effective in certain patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus over a prolonged time period
 effect of glipizide treatment on various aspects of glucose, insulin, and lipid metabolism in patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 glipizide is a "second generation" sulfonylurea compound, and in this study the effects of several months of glipizide treatment on various aspects of glucose, insulin, and lipid metabolism were documented in 23 patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 insulin secretion and action in noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 is insulin resistance secondary to hypoinsulinemia? the insulin-stimulated glucose metabolic clearance rate, assessed by the insulin clamp technique, was compared in 40 normal subjects and 40 age- and weight-matched patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 these studies were conducted at steady-state plasma insulin levels of approximately 100 microu/ml, and the mean (+/- standard error of the mean) glucose metabolic clearance rate of patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was 81 +/- 9 ml/m2 per minute, as compared with a value of 235 +/- 14 ml/m2 per minute for normal subjects
001) and documents the extreme resistance to insulin-stimulated glucose utilization seen in noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus were also shown to have a lower than normal plasma insulin response to an oral glucose challenge
 in contrast, ambient plasma insulin concentrations of normal subjects and patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus were found to be quite comparable when measured throughout the day in response to the ingestion of conventional mixed meals
 consequently, absolute hypoinsulinemia is not characteristic of patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus under conditions of daily living
 these results have corroborated the fact that abnormalities of both insulin action and secretion can be documented in patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 however, patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus were not found to be absolutely hypoinsulinemic in their daily existence, and control of their hyperglycemia with exogenous insulin did not restore insulin-stimulated glucose utilization to normal
 consequently, these data are not consistent with the view that the insulin resistance in noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is entirely a secondary consequence of the hypoinsulinemia presumed to be present in these patients
 clinical utility of oral hypoglycemic agents in the management of patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 the results of such studies indicate that approximately 60 to 70 percent of the patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus of recent onset will respond initially to sulfonylurea therapy with satisfactory control of glycemia, about 15 to 20 percent will not respond initially (primary failures), and another 15 to 20 percent who respond initially will lose their responsiveness during the first few years of treatment (secondary failures)
 in extensive studies in small numbers of patients, we found that successful management of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with glipizide was correlated with increased insulin responsiveness and that patients who did not have an increase in their insulin-mediated glucose disposal during glipizide therapy were primary failures
 successful treatment of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with sulfonylureas is associated with onset of of the disease at 40 years of age or later, normal or increased body weight, duration of disease less than five years, and a history of either no previous insulin therapy or therapy with less than 20 units of insulin per day
 the possibility of preventive intervention in type i or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm) during periods of latency and partial remission of the disease has stimulated the search for agents that interfere with the genesis of iddm by acting on its etiology and/or by protecting the beta cell against different aggressions
 to investigate the effect of pregnancy on the course of streptozotocin (stz) induced diabetes, insulin binding to receptors and glucose transport activity were studied in isolated adipocytes from normal nonpregnant, normal pregnant, stz-treated nonpregnant and stz-treated pregnant rats

 insulin action in isolated adipocytes is reduced additively by pregnancy and diabetes

 on the pathogenesis of type ii diabetes with special reference to diminished insulin response and obesity: a 5-12 year follow-up study of subjects with borderline glucose tolerance
 in a 5-12 year follow-up study of 288 subjects with borderline glucose tolerance, 56 of them worsened to overt noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus (niddm)
 bwi) and a diminished insulin response to glucose load were significant independent risk factors for worsening to diabetes
 diabetes developed almost exclusively from low insulin responders in 253 non- or mildly obese subjects, while in 35 severely obese subjects a certain number of 'normal or high' insulin responders did develop diabetes
 in conclusion, the majority of cases of niddm develop on the basis of low insulin secretion, with an additional precipitating factor of obesity, and, in some with higher insulin responses diabetes develops when extreme obesity exists, though these cases form a minor group in japan today
 diabetogenic obesity may evolve through 5 stages from initial obesity without diabetes to insulin dependent diabetes in previously obese subjects

) were measured in 70 non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus patients
 interestingly, insulinopenic diabetes was not accompanied by hyperlipoproteinemia, but hyperinsulinemic cases remained hyperlipoproteinemic
 therefore, the possibility arises that the independent occurrence of diabetes mellitus and hyperlipoproteinemia suggested by this crosssectional segregation study may result from bidirectional deviations in individuals who started out with uniform familial disorders such as insulin resistance

 fasting early morning rise in peripheral insulin: evidence of the dawn phenomenon in nondiabetes
 the dawn phenomenon, a tendency for glucose to rise between 0500 and 0800 h in subjects with diabetes, is also reflected as an increase in insulin required to maintain normoglycemia during closed-loop insulin infusion
 to test the hypothesis that the absence of early morning glucose increases in subjects without diabetes is due to an increase in insulin levels, we measured insulin levels from 2400 to 0800 h in four male and two female volunteers
 the observed increase in insulin in the early morning hours despite stable levels of glucose indicates a temporally increased insulin need in nondiabetic individuals similar to that found in individuals with diabetes
 the mechanism underlying this increased insulin need may be similar in diabetes and nondiabetes, with the ensuing rise in glucose being dependent on the availability of compensatory insulin

 [remission induced at the early stage of insulin-dependent diabetes: do predictive factors exist?]
 the induction of a remission has been attempted in 28 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes of less than 3 months' duration by strictly normalizing glycemia either with a period of external artificial pancreas followed by continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (22 patients) or with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion alone (6 patients)
 the hormonal deviations are associated with the disturbances in the carbohydrate metabolism, have a reactive character and are manifested in insulin-dependent type of diabetes
 duration of type i diabetes affects glucagon and glucose responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia
 to identify predictive factors for this abnormality and for the capability of glycemic counterregulation, we investigated the relationship between the duration of diabetes and glucagon and glucose responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia
 thus, having diabetes for more than ten years implied that not only were glucagon responses to insulin hypoglycemia severely compromised but also that the abrupt restoration of plasma glucose levels was impaired

 overtly hypertriglyceridemic patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus were given a control diet containing 120 g of sucrose and 50 percent carbohydrate, and later randomly assigned to receive isocaloric high- (220 g), intermediate- (120 g), or low- (less than 3 g) sucrose/carbohydrate diets for four weeks
 thus, although very high sucrose and carbohydrate consumption is clearly deleterious to fasting tryglyceride levels in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with preexisting hypertriglyceridemia, it appears that low dietary sucrose and carbohydrate proportions do not further improve preprandial glycemia and glycosuria and may adversely affect late postprandial serum triglyceride concentration

 evidence for decreasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus in childhood apparently produced by prevention of hyperinsulinism in the foetus and newborn
 in view of experimental and clinical findings, it was predicted (dörner, 1973 and 1976; dörner and mohnike, 1973 and 1977) that a preventive therapy of diabetes mellitus may be possible by preventing hyperinsulinism in perinatal life by means of prevention of hyperglycaemia in pregnant women and overnutrition in newborns

 alpha-glucosidase inhibition improves postprandial hyperglycemia and decreases insulin requirements in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 in patients with diabetes mellitus, delayed increases in circulating insulin levels followed by prolonged hyperinsulinemia due to slow absorption of subcutaneously administered insulin hinders maintenance of euglycemia
 to determine whether a delay in carbohydrate absorption would increase the effectiveness of subcutaneous insulin in controlling postprandial hyperglycemia in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and whether it could allow insulin to be taken immediately prior to meals, the effects of an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor (acarbose boyer ag, wuppertal, germany) on postprandial plasma glucose profiles were determined in six subjects with insulin-dependent diabetes when a subcutaneous insulin infusion was started immediately or 30 minutes prior to meal ingestion
 these results indicate that delay in carbohydrate absorption improves the effectiveness of subcutaneous insulin in controlling postprandial hyperglycemia in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and may permit satisfactory postprandial glycemic control when insulin is administered immediately prior to meal ingestion
 thus, an agent like acarbose, which delays carbohydrate absorption, may be useful as an adjunct to insulin in the treatment of diabetes mellitus

 effects of salicylate, tolbutamide, and prostaglandin e2 on insulin responses to glucose in noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 to assess whether the beneficial effects of salicylates compounds and sulfonylureas on insulin secretion in patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus could be ascribed to inhibition of prostaglandin e (pge) synthesis, insulin responses to iv glucose pulses were determined in diabetic patients during infusion of lysine acetylsalicylate (las) or tolbutamide, with or without a concurrent infusion of pge2
 these results indicate that salicylates, but not sulfonylureas, exert their acute insulinotropic effect in noninsulin-dependent diabetic patients by inhibiting endogenous pge synthesis and support the idea that endogenous pge may play a role in the impaired insulin response to glucose in this form of human diabetes

 normal hepatic insulin receptor autophosphorylation in nonketotic diabetes mellitus
 to determine if the postbinding hepatic insulin resistance of nonketotic diabetes mellitus could reside in an inability of insulin to stimulate insulin receptor autophosphorylation, we evaluated the ability of insulin to stimulate 32p incorporation into the beta subunit of lectin-purified rat liver plasma membrane insulin receptors
 the previous data from our laboratory indicates that hepatic insulin resistance in non-ketotic streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus is present despite normal to increased insulin binding, is selective, is reversible with insulin treatment and involves an inability of insulin to stimulate the release of the putative mediator of insulin action
 we conclude, therefore, that the hepatic insulin resistance of nonketotic diabetes mellitus resides distal to insulin receptor binding and autophosphorylation and is reflected in metabolic events at or near the plasma membrane which may include the generation or release of the putative mediator of insulin action
 in respect of their influence on insulin pharmacokinetics, moderate concentrations of insulin antibodies may be of positive advantage to all diabetics without endogenous insulin secretion and are not responsible for the insulin resistance of type 1 diabetes

 plasma pancreatic polypeptide response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia as a marker for defective glucose counterregulation in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 the reduction in blood glucose in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (niddm) brought about by the use of phenobarbital (pb), a hepatic microsomal enzyme inducer, suggests an improvement in insulin sensitivity
 correlates of insulin antibodies in newly diagnosed children with insulin-dependent diabetes before insulin therapy
 cells cultured on glass coverslips were used to detect, by indirect immunofluorescence, islet cell surface antibodies (icsa) in the sera of patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 of 15 sera from patients with newly diagnosed insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 9 were icsa positive, whereas all of 10 control sera were negative; in contrast, using rat insulinoma cells only 4 diabetic sera were positive, as well as 2 control sera

 insulin-stimulated glucose disposal in patients with type i (iddm) and type ii (niddm) diabetes mellitus
 pathophysiology of insulin secretion in diabetes mellitus
 in patients with noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus (niddm), basal insulin levels have usually been reported as normal, but if plasma glucose is lowered to normal levels, a deficiency of basal insulin becomes apparent
 in patients with long-standing insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm), basal insulin secretion and insulin responses to all stimuli are virtually absent
 insulin-dependent and noninsulin-dependent diabetes usually represent syndromes whose etiopathology is believed to differ and their clinical characteristics are usually distinctive
 as evidence of etiological heterogeneity has increased there has been a tendency to adopt the terms type i and type ii diabetes to indicate different etiologies, although the original usage of these terms was as a clinical classification to differentiate between insulin dependent and non-insulin-dependent disease
 insulin resistance in non-insulin dependent (type ii) and insulin dependent (type i) diabetes mellitus
 insulin resistance is a characteristic feature of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (niddm) due to target tissue defects in insulin action
 the greater the severity of the diabetes (greater fasting hyperglycemia) the greater the post-receptor defect, and in those patients with more significant fasting hyperglycemia the post-receptor defect is the predominant abnormality leading to the insulin resistant state
 one of insulin's major biologic effects is the promotion of overall glucose metabolism, and abnormalities of this aspect of insulin action can lead to a number of important clinical and pathophysiologic states including type ii diabetes, also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (niddm)
 insulin-mediated and non-insulin-mediated metabolic effects of gastroenteropancreatic peptides in type i and type ii diabetes
 with respect to the possible pathophysiologic roles of regulatory peptides of the gastroenteropancreatic system other than insulin and glucagon, a number of considerations of type i and type ii diabetes have been raised
 the balance of the evidence suggests that type i diabetes may be viewed as an insulin deficiency syndrome, so that physiological replacement with insulin may be expected to result in correction of the metabolic abnormalities
 nevertheless, the difficulty of physiologic replacement treatment, which may call for portal delivery of insulin, is well recognized, and abnormalities secondary to insulin deficiency even in "well-treated" type i diabetes may be compounded by the effects of gastroenteropancreatic peptides other than insulin, exerted through the various mechanisms discussed
 the incidence and prevalence of diabetic neuropathies in insulin dependent (iddm) and non-insulin dependent (niddm) diabetes mellitus is not known because in previous studies the heterogeneity of diabetes and of the neuropathies was not taken into account, criteria for diagnosis and surveillance for neuropathy were variable, and studies were not prospective or population based
 the natural history of carbohydrate metabolism and of insulin secretory responses to glucose in early type i diabetes and in mody with low insulin secretory responses are illustrated and similarities and dissimilarities compared and contrasted
 the recognition that type i or insulin-dependent diabetes (iddm) and type ii or noninsulin-dependent (niddm) differ from each other not only phenotypically but also in etiology and pathogenesis led the national diabetes data group (nddg) to devise the present nomenclature and classification of diabetes mellitus

 insulin resistance is a prominent feature of three clinical conditions: obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, and non-insulin-dependent (type ii) diabetes mellitus
 islet-cell abnormalities in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus have enlarged islets of langerhans, an increased number of insulin-secreting beta cells, and a "horseshoe-shaped" relationship between plasma insulin and glucose levels
 defects in the glucagon-secreting alpha cells in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus include basal hyperglucagonemia, an exaggerated glucagon response to aminogenic stimuli, and hyposuppressibility of glucagon by hyperglycemia
 although peripheral resistance to insulin may play a role in type ii diabetes, defects in islet-cell function clearly play a significant role as well
 treatment strategies for patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 strategies for the treatment of patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus are discussed

 blood glucose and plasma insulin responses to hypoglycemic agents in normal subjects and patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus are presented
 interim data from the united kingdom's prospective study of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus are presented
 it is concluded that sulfonylurea drugs have a role in the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, but that each patient must be treated individually since the disease is heterogeneous
 glucose regulation in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 the degree of fasting hyperglycemia in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is dependent on the rate of hepatic glucose production
 the basal rate of hepatic glucose production is increased in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and there is a positive correlation between hepatic glucose production and fasting glucose levels
 diminished secretion of insulin, impaired hepatic sensitivity to insulin's effects, or a combination of these factors could contribute to the elevated hepatic glucose production in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 although fasting insulin levels are usually comparable between patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and normal subjects, insulin secretion is markedly impaired in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in relation to the degree of hyperglycemia present
 in fact, the degree of fasting hyperglycemia in a given patient with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is closely related to the degree of impaired pancreatic beta-cell responsiveness to glucose
 chronic sulfonylurea drug therapy of patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus enhances pancreatic islet sensitivity to glucose, leading to increased insulin secretion, suppression of hepatic glucose production, and a decline in the steady-state fasting glucose level
 the principal endocrine components of these syndromes are adrenal insufficiency, autoimmune thyroid disease, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and premature gonadal failure

 poor growth follows impaired insulin secretion in diabetes mellitus
 insulin has a direct action on release of igf's from the liver in vitro, but during experimental diabetes there is a reduced number of hepatic somatotropic receptors which could limit the ability of growth hormone to regulate igf release
 increased clinic visits were also significantly associated with younger age, a higher number of prescribed medications and the requirement for insulin therapy, higher knowledge scores, and two health beliefs, the belief that diabetes is more serious than curable illnesses, and the belief that the treatment is likely to help
 evidence is accumulating that the development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus involves autoimmune phenomena, both in the human and in the bb rat model

 mechanisms of insulin resistance in non-insulin-dependent (type ii) diabetes
 characteristic of both obesity and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance is triggered at the level of the target tissue and can be induced by three general categories of causes: (1) an abnormal beta cell secretory product, (2) circulating insulin antagonists, or (3) a target tissue defect in insulin action
 impaired glucose uptake and subsequent increased hepatic glucose oxidation in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus are major contributing factors to fasting hyperglycemia
 glyburide and other sulfonylureas consistently enhance receptor binding in cells from patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, whereas no effects and mixed effects have been demonstrated in cells from patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and in normal cells, respectively
 in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, these drugs exert clinical efficacy by acting through both mechanisms
 in adipocytes from patients with type ii non-insulin-dependent diabetes, there is increasing evidence indicating that sulfonylureas ameliorate a post-receptor defect in insulin action by potentiating the insulin-stimulated glucose transport normally seen in these cells

 nonsuppressible insulin-like activity and somatomedin c levels in normal pregnant women, in pregnant women with gestational diabetes, and in umbilical cord blood of mature and premature infants
 this study was undertaken to determine the significance of the changes in nonsuppressible insulin-like activity as measured by the fat pad assay and by the levels of immunoreactive somatomedin c, growth hormone, and human placental lactogen in sera of term normal pregnant women, mothers who delivered prematurely, and women with gestational diabetes at term as compared to normal nonpregnant subjects
 our investigations showed that (1) nonsuppressible insulin-like activity is elevated during pregnancy, but its level was lower in mothers with gestational diabetes in spite of significantly higher serum human placental lactogen compared with normal pregnant mothers; (2) nonsuppressible insulin-like activity is significantly lower in premature infants than in term infants; (3) somatomedin c levels were significantly elevated in pregnant mothers in spite of suppression of growth hormone; (4) nonsuppressible insulin-like activity and somatomedin c levels in infants of mothers with gestational diabetes were not significantly elevated in spite of higher birth weight, indicating that nonsuppressible insulin-like activity and somatomedins are not the only factors responsible for the increase of birth weight of children of diabetic mothers; (5) there was marked discordance between the growth hormone level in the neonates and somatomedin c levels
 to test the possibility that cytokines participate in the autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta-cells leading to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, isolated human or rat islets of langerhans were incubated for 7 days with cytokine-rich, cell-free supernatants of blood mononuclear cells from healthy human donors stimulated with or without purified protein derivative of tuberculin or phytohaemagglutinin

 we investigated the influence of a program of exercise training consisting of three weekly sessions, each 45 min long, for 12 wk, on indices of physical fitness, glycemic control, and insulin sensitivity in nine adolescents with type i diabetes; six age-matched adolescents with diabetes of equivalent duration served as nonexercised controls
 we conclude that exercise training may be a valuable adjunct in managing type i diabetes providing there is concomitant attention to diet and insulin
 there were substantial alterations in care, with more of the charts meeting the standard in each of the eight categories under investigation: diabetes diagnosis according to national diabetes data group criteria, urine testing, capillary blood testing, rotation of insulin injection site, assessment of patients for adherence to regimen, assessment of patient skills and knowledge, and interdisciplinary coordination of care
 self-monitoring of blood glucose, if prescribed by the physician, becomes part of routine clinical treatment for insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetes and therefore should be paid by the usual payment mechanisms

 these results indicate that in alloxan-induced diabetes, the observed depressed lymphatic tissue weight and cellular proliferation are not simply due to the elevated plasma level of corticosteroids, but are either a result of the insulin deficiency per se or due to other metabolic alterations associated with the diabetic condition
 the mechanisms of up-regulation of the hepatic insulin receptor in hypoinsulinemic diabetes mellitus
 such a release may play a role in the day-to-day control of blood glucose, and its disturbance might underlie non-insulin-dependent diabetes

 nonhuman primate models of atherosclerosis: potential for the study of diabetes mellitus and hyperinsulinemia
 atherosclerosis and insulin in primates with diabetes mellitus
 the most commonly available primate models of diabetes mellitus are of the insulin-dependent type and are attained through beta cell ablation techniques
 noninsulin-dependent primate models are less common since the animals must have a genetic predisposition to diabetes
 as it is clear that hyperinsulinemia is often present in diabetes, either in relation to mild glucose intolerance or obesity (in noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) or because of insulin therapy (in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus), it is essential that further consideration should be given to the possibility that hyperinsulinemia may have harmful effects on the arterial wall
 effects of insulin on physical factors: atherosclerosis in diabetes mellitus
 in a cross-sectional study sera of 130 children and adolescents with insulin dependent (type i) diabetes were tested for the presence of cytoplasmatic islet cell antibodies (ica), thyroid microsomal antibodies (tma) as well as thyroid function (t3, t4, thyrotrophin)

 [pathogenesis of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus]
 insulin-dependent and independent types of diabetes mellitus differ not only in clinical traits but also in some other peculiarities: a different degree of disorder of insulin secretion, relationship with the hla system, the presence of antibodies to pancreatic islets
 the latter antibodies are typical of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus whereas in insulin-independent diabetes mellitus they are absent

 two types of immune complexes were formed in diabetes mellitus patients: insulin--antiinsulin antibodies and insulin--vldl
 [problems of compensation of the insulin-dependent form of diabetes mellitus]
 the decompensation of the insulin-dependent type of diabetes mellitus under domestic conditions results from a low level of education of patients and their family members with regard to therapy of this disease, a formalistic attitude to doctor's recommendations and the absence of a regular control over a course of disease
 some patients and often physicians believe that the most effective measure for improving carbohydrate metabolism is to raise a dose of insulin which leads to the development of a syndrome of chronic overdosage and a more severe course of diabetes mellitus
 altogether 100 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus of a labile course were treated using the biostator unit (artificial pancreas)
 a pronounced and long-term antidiabetic effect was observed in wost of the recepients subjected to the intramuscular human fetal pic culture transplantation: demand in exogenous insulin decreased, a durable stabilization of a course of disease in patients with labile diabetes mellitus was observed, and in patients with such diabetic complications as polyneuropathy, retinopathy and glomerulosclerosis certain regress of these complications was observed
 a high proteolytic activity of the blood in decompensated diabetes mellitus resulted in insulin inactivation

 the frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis and hypoglycemic coma in a large series of patients with insulin-dependent diabetes treated by long-term continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion was compared with the frequency of these events in a matched group of patients treated by conventional insulin injections at the same hospital over the same period of time
 for most women with insulin-dependent diabetes, this goal may be achieved through the use of multiple insulin injections combined with an appropriate dietary intake
 this study forms the basis of later investigations which show that haplotype sharing of affected sib trios for two susceptibility alleles (negative complementation) model, which appears appropriate for insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm), moves outside the bound of the single susceptibility expectations outlined here, whereas haplotype sharing values for sib pairs are bound by the single susceptibility allele expectations
 second, only 40% of patients with medical illnesses, including malignant neoplasm, insulin-dependent diabetes, and epilepsy, responded to treatment
 comparison of acute and prolonged effects of glibenclamide and chlorpropamide in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes
 the effects of single oral dose of glibenclamide (gilemid 5 mg) and chlorpropamide (250 mg) on serum insulin and glucose levels and electrolyte (sodium, potassium) balance were studied, in a cross-over double-blind manner, in 11 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes
 the results suggest that, in non-insulin-dependent diabetes, a single oral dose of glibenclamide acts as long as that of chlorpropamide, and that in long-term therapy 5 mg of glibenclamide is equipotent with 250 mg of chlorpropamide
 methyl palmoxirate treatment (25 mg kg-1 day-1 po daily) was unable to control diabetes-induced changes in plasma glucose, triglycerides, insulin, and total lipids
 in contrast, the levels of c5-aa in the serum of all patients (11/11) with chronic type 1 diabetes were significantly higher than in control type 2 patients (noninsulin-dependent diabetes) (p less than 0
0005) and 4 of 7 patients with new onset insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus also had significantly higher levels of c5-aa than the type 2 patients (p less than 0

 to detect myocardiopathy in a selected group of 14 patients (aged 21-38 years, duration of diabetes 10-20 years) with insulin-dependent diabetes, we have performed equilibrium gated nuclear angiography with fourier filtered analysis
 it is concluded that equilibrium gated nuclear angiography in combination with fourier filtered analysis is a sensitive method of detecting myocardial abnormalities in patients suffering from insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus without cardiac symptoms
 increasing evidence that type 1 (insulin dependent) diabetes mellitus is an autoimmune disease, together with successful cure/prevention in animal models of this disease (e
 the results suggest that a remarkable reduction in physical activity, along with an increased caloric intake, may have importance in determining the prevalence and time of appearance of non-insulin-dependent diabetes
 we report our first experience with a new microprocessor device for assisting individuals with diabetes in the adjustment of insulin therapy

 the effect of strict metabolic control for 1 yr on renal function and retinal morphology was estimated in 24 insulin-dependent diabetic individuals (age 29 +/- 8 yr, diabetes duration 10 +/- 6 yr) with albustix negative urine and minimal or no background retinopathy before the study
 they were free of family diabetes history, glucose intolerance, hypertriglyceridemia, hepatic or renal failure or factor of insulin resistance such as infectious diseases
 sexual dysfunction was correlated to peripheral neuropathy but not to retinopathy, nephropathy, reduced beat-to-beat variation, regulation quality, insulin treatment and age at diabetes onset

 taking together both studies, to successfully overcome several decades of diabetes appears to be associated with age, age of onset, body weight, blood pressure, daily insulin dose, serum triglycerides, dietetic adherence and degree of compliance
 the diabetes population consisted of 533 diabetics of whom 166 were insulin-dependent (type i) and 367 non-insulin-dependent (type ii)
 there are two different classes of humoral growth factors for arterial smooth muscle and endothelial cells that age of potential relevance for the development of macrovascular disease inn diabetes mellitus: hormones (growth hormone, insulin like growth factor i and ii, insulin) and locally released growth factors of platelet origin
 insulin like growth factor i and ii are present in vivo and stimulate growth of vascular cells in vitro but their relevance for macrovascular disease in diabetes is unproven
 hyperinsulinaemia--a possible risk factor for cardiovascular disease in diabetes mellitus
 in non-insulin dependent diabetes this is due to the associated obesity while in insulin treated diabetics exogenous insulin is responsible for hyperinsulinaemia between meals and at night
 the evidence linking hyperinsulinaemia to the cardiovascular complications and diabetes is suggestive but incomplete and much more information on predictive factors for arterial disease in diabetes is urgently required
 both non-insulin dependent and insulin dependent diabetes appear to be associated with cardiovascular disease
 coronary heart disease mortality in relation with diabetes, blood glucose and plasma insulin levels
 high serum insulin concentrations in relation to other cardiovascular risk factors in macrovascular disease of type 2 diabetes
 historically, the two groups were well matched regarding the following variables: age, duration of diabetes, insulin therapy, previous oral agent therapy, hypertension, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, renal disease, sensory neuropathy, and smoking
 hypertriglyceridemia in insulin dependent diabetes mellitus with peripheral vascular disease
 in 77 insulin dependent diabetes (iddm) (23 m, 54 f, age: 52 +/- 18 y
 control of diabetes (hopeful, but not proven); aging--useful but only in as much as good treatment might retard the aging process (questionable); obesity--a great generality (possibly helpful); lipids and lipoproteins (probably helpful, although more specifics needed); hyperinsulinism (questionable--more studies underway); platelet changes and coagulation (probably an important area--much investigation underway); there is no real evidence that any oral hypoglycemic agent is specific for treatment in these areas
 107 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm) were typed for hla a, b, c-, and dr antigens, and for complement c4a, c4b, and bf alleles, and the results were compared with those of a combined reference group of 332 appropriately matched healthy subjects
 the purpose of our prospective study was to evaluate the long-term effect of aggressive antihypertensive treatment on glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria in young female and male patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with diabetic nephropathy and blood pressure greater than 90 mm hg
 indapamide in the treatment of hypertension in non-insulin-dependent diabetes
 it was evaluated in a series of 20 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes (age range 47-75 years) who had arterial hypertension of mild to moderate degree treated with hypoglycemic agents and/or diet
 effect of indapamide on blood pressure and glucose tolerance in non-insulin-dependent diabetes
 we measured the blood pressure under standardized conditions in three groups of patients with type i (insulin-dependent) diabetes: group 1, patients with albustix-negative urine and normal urinary albumin excretion rate below 20 micrograms/min; group 2, patients with albustix-negative urine and elevated urinary albumin excretion rate 20 to 200 micrograms/min; and group 3, patients with albustix-positive urine at the time of diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy, that is, proteinuria greater than 0
 in metabolically stable nonazotemic diabetes, exchangeable sodium is increased by 10% on average, regardless of age, insulin dependence or nondependence, or the presence or absence of diabetic retinopathy or clinical nephropathy (proteinuria greater than or equal to 0
 these results suggest a causal relationship between the level of circulating insulin and diastolic blood pressure, and support the concept that hyperinsulinemia may be the common link in the clustering of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity
 a retrospective 5-year study examined the relationship between blood pressure and the severity and progression of mild background retinopathy in 48 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes and 38 with insulin-dependent diabetes who did not receive treatment in either eye for at least 3 years from their initial visit
 initial mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures (mm hg) were significantly higher in those with non-insulin-dependent diabetes (149/88) than in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes (129/81)
 blood pressures initially and at 3 years were not significantly different between patients who received photocoagulation (five with insulin-dependent and six with non-insulin-dependent diabetes and those who did not in either group

 immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes are often discussed as susceptibility genes for insulin dependent (type 1) diabetes mellitus (iddm) in addition to hla-dr3 and dr4
 the effects of aspartame (l-aspartyl-l-phenylalanine methyl ester) on plasma glucose and insulin levels were investigated in diabetic rats and patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 also, 225 mg oral aspartame loading, which is equivalent to 75 g of glucose in sweetness, to patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus did not increase plasma glucose or insulin levels, although 75 g of oral glucose loading increased plasma glucose and insulin levels in diabetic patients as expected
 these results suggest that acute administration of aspartame has no influence on plasma glucose or insulin levels in diabetic rats and patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 defects in neutrophil or polymorphonuclear leukocyte (pmnl) chemotaxis have been observed in a number of clinical conditions, including down's syndrome and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm), which tend to be associated with severe forms of periodontal disease
 retinal circulatory changes related to retinopathy progression in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 [protis, an expert system applied to the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes

 a polymorphic dna sequence of the apolipoprotein (apo) a-i gene region was studied in relation to non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (niddm)
 effect of streptozotocin-induced diabetes on insulin binding parameters in adult rat testis
 insulin binding decrease was ascribed to the well-known depressing effect of diabetes mellitus on circulating luteinizing hormone (lh)
 similarly, the presence of these antibodies in patients apparently with type ii diabetes (non-insulin dependent) was associated with an increased risk of developing insulin dependence
 the desensitization of cells by diabetes to the effects of insulin is therefore probably not related to the response of cells to adenosine
 to determine the relationship between thrombin generation and platelet secretion in vivo in diabetes mellitus, we measured simultaneous plasma beta-thromboglobulin (btg) and fibrinopeptide a (fpa) in 40 insulin-dependent patients without renal disease, and 20 control subjects of similar age
 age, duration of diabetes, insulin dose and insulin preparation used showed no association with the lymphocyte response or the insulin antibody titre
 we have investigated the relationship between diabetic retinopathy and cigarette smoking, blood pressure, control of blood glucose, duration of diabetes and insulin requirement in a cross sectional study of 193 adult patients attending 2 diabetic follow-up clinics
 during this period, her diabetes was well controlled with continuous subcutaneous infusion of insulin at a dose of 500 u/24 hr
 it is concluded: the jejunal uptake of glucose and galactose is increased in diabetic rats, but the kinetic basis for this change was different for the two sugars; insulin therapy may correct the enhanced uptake of some nutrients in diabetic rats and islet cell transplantation may be at least as effective as exogenous insulin in modifying the intestinal adaptation to diabetes
 changes in insulin secretion after secretin administration and the implications in diabetes mellitus
 tokyo, japan) was administered to 9 healthy volunteers and 36 patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (niddm) to clarify the effect of secretin on the pancreatic b-cell, by determining the changes in blood of insulin (iri)
 therefore, insulin response to a secretin load can be useful in assessing endogenous insulin secretion and provides a pertinent clinical guide for the selection of an appropriate therapy for diabetes mellitus
 streptozotocin diabetes inhibits rat liver homogenate [2-14c]-dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid delta 5-desaturation; only moderate injections of protamine-zinc-insulin restore the in vitro delta 5-desaturation
 these results suggest that experimental diabetes, a reported inhibitor of delta 6-desaturation, also causes partial inhibition of delta 5-desaturation in rat liver; this suggests that dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid desaturation, a secondary regulatory step in linoleic acid metabolism, may be restored through an optimum insulin therapy
 influence of alloxan diabetes and insulin treatment on the activity of alanine aminotransferase in rat brain regions, liver and heart
 malate-aspartate shuttle enzymes in rat brain regions, liver and heart during alloxan diabetes and insulin replacement
 insulin treatment to diabetic animals restored the enzymes to near control levels at early stages of diabetes, except in liver
 impaired insulin secretion in human diabetes mellitus
 non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type ii) is characterized by the loss of the acute insulin response to glucose

 further evidence for a preventive therapy of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in the offspring by avoiding maternal hyperglycaemia during pregnancy
 a highly significantly decreased prevalence of insulin-dependent childhood-onset diabetes (less than 1/3 of the initial prevalence rate) could be achieved in berlin/gdr since 1973 by improving systematically diagnostic and therapeutic measures for pregnant diabetics, particularly for non-insulin-dependent gestational diabetics
 in view of these findings, an interruption and even a reversal of the continued dramatic increase of idiopathic insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus appears to be possible in the developed countries by preventing maternal hyperglycaemia during pregnancy and hence hyperinsulinism in the foetuses and newborns
 since mumps virus seems to be one of the most likely candidates in viral etiology of insulin-dependent diabetes (iddm) we studied the possible relationship of glucose tolerance (75 g ogtt), beta cell function, diabetes associated hla antigens, haptoglobin phenotype, islet cell antibodies (ica) and islet cell surface antibodies (icsa) in 125 subjects with antecedent mumps infection

 reduction of diabetes incidence of bb wistar rats by early prophylactic insulin treatment of diabetes-prone animals
 a group of 36 diabetes-prone bb wistar rats were given prophylactic insulin treatment with heat-treated bovine ultralente insulin (15 iu x kg-1 x day-1) from 50 to 142 days of age
 the incidence of type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes at the end of the treatment period was compared to that of 36 control animals given insulin only from the first day of glycosuria
 at withdrawal of the prophylactic insulin treatment, 6 of 36 treated animals were insulin-dependent, while 15 of 36 control animals had developed diabetes (p less than 0
 one control animal (day 153) and 2 insulin-treated animals (day 172 and 186) subsequently developed diabetes, yielding an overall diabetes incidence of 16 of 36 controls against 8 of 36 insulin treated (p less than 0
 the finding that prophylactic insulin treatment of diabetes-prone bb wistar rats reduced the incidence of diabetes suggests a relationship of the immune destruction of b cells to the endogenous insulin production/secretion rate
 as a function of experience gained in the hospital saint-joseph with vascular surgery in diabetics, results of revascularization in diabetics were compared with those in non-diabetic patients (the possible influence of the type of diabetes-particularly whether insulin-dependent or not- could not be assessed because of the variable use of insulin apart from precise cases)

 clinically manifest coronary heart disease (chd) is not uncommon in diabetics with insulin-dependent type of the disease below the age of 40, particularly when the duration of diabetes is long
 clinically manifest chd is very common in diabetics with maturity-onset, non-insulin-dependent type of the disease, and in this type of diabetes the frequency of chd shows little or no relation to the duration of diabetes
 subclinical abnormalities of left ventricular function are common in diabetics and these abnormalities appear to show some relationship to the metabolic control of diabetes and in insulin-dependent diabetics also to the presence of microangiopathy

 the concentrations of zinc and magnesium in serum were investigated in 23 non-pregnant and 14 pregnant women with insulin-dependent diabetes (iddm) and 20 with gestational diabetes, and in cord blood from newborns of the latter two groups
 although a decrease in s-zn and s-mg was observed during pregnancy in both iddm and control subjects, the difference between carefully insulin-treated iddm patients and controls was no longer apparent at term of pregnancy as regards s-zn, whereas s-mg was lower at term both in iddm patients and in insulin-treated women with gestational diabetes
 besides the probable importance of a nearly normalized glucose metabolism in iddm patients during pregnancy, it is postulated that the altered pattern of plasma proteins in diabetes and pregnancy, and possibly also exogenous insulin may influence the serum concentrations of zinc and magnesium seen at the end of pregnancy

 to assess the pharmacologic properties and possible use in the treatment of diabetes mellitus of a recently developed analogue somatostatin (l-363,586), the analogue (2, 5, 10 or 40 micrograms/hr), somatostatin (200 micrograms/hr), or placebo were infused intravenously for 5 hours in 6 insulin-dependent diabetic subjects who were given a standard meal containing xylose
 we conclude that l-363,586 is a long-acting and potent analogue of somatostatin, which has the potential for use as an adjunct to insulin in the treatment of diabetes mellitus
 in the rats with diabetes of one week duration, insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake was not impaired, whereas basal 2-deoxyglucose uptake was decreased

 impaired insulin secretion in human diabetes mellitus
 to evaluate whether the gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba)ergic system plays a role in the defective insulin secretion in human diabetes mellitus, 15 non-insulin-dependent diabetics with fasting hyperglycemia above 140 mg/dl were submitted to two consecutive i
 these results seem to indicate that gaba does not play a major role in the pathogenesis of defective insulin secretion in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 the gabaergic control of prolactin release is not affected by insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus: evidence from studies with sodium valproate
 thus, long-term bhi treatment of type i diabetics does not cause any major change in plasma lipid and apolipoprotein patterns in comparison with animal insulin therapy, so that the validity of using bhi in the treatment of type i diabetes is confirmed

 igg and igm class insulin autoantibodies were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in sera from members of the barts-windsor-middlesex prospective family study for type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes
 in addition, a significant association of igg insulin autoantibodies with subsequent development of diabetes was observed within the cf-islet cell antibody positive group (p less than 0
 we conclude that the presence of igg insulin autoantibodies and cf-islet cell antibodies confer more risk for future development of diabetes than the presence of either marker alone

 recent case reports have suggested an association between anorexia nervosa and/or bulimia with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm)
 to define the role of these factors we have measured muscle capillary basement membrane thickness in controls, insulin dependent diabetics, and individuals with diabetes secondary to the ingestion of vacor, a rat poison, which results in hyperglycemia
 the present study provides strong evidence that even in the absence of genetic diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or some other abnormality related to insulin lack can cause microvascular changes

 hepatocytes from obese patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes were resistant to maximal insulin concentration, and those from obese controls to submaximal insulin concentration in comparison to nonobese controls
 in diabetes, diminished insulin-stimulated protein kinase activity and decreased intracellular pool of receptors could provide an explanation for postinsulin-binding defect(s) of insulin action in human liver
 only one dq-beta restriction fragment pattern of each dr specificity is associated with insulin-dependent diabetes
 insulin-dependent diabetes is generally associated with the serologic hla-dr specificities 3 and 4, in particular with dr-3,4 heterozygosity
 to investigate these associations further at the genomic level, dna from 13 families with a proband having insulin-dependent diabetes, from 11 other individuals with the same disease, and from hla-dr-matched control individuals was subjected to restriction fragment analysis
 thus, dq-beta genomic hybridization may be used in conjunction with hla-dr typing to identify individuals with higher relative risk to acquire insulin-dependent diabetes
 these results may suggest that insulin-dependent diabetes is associated with the dq rather than with the dr locus
 prompt antibiotic therapy and insulin injections to control the diabetes usually cure these serious infections

 third, we performed studies of tritiated-insulin absorption in three additional diabetic patients and three control patients with nonbrittle diabetes
 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus often have poor metabolic control during puberty
 to determine whether puberty is associated with decreased insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism, we compared the results of euglycemic insulin-clamp studies in adults and prepubertal and pubertal children with and without insulin-dependent diabetes
 at each stage of development, the stimulating effect of insulin on glucose metabolism was decreased by 33 to 42 percent in the children with diabetes (p less than 0
 these data suggest that insulin resistance occurs during puberty in both normal children and children with diabetes
 the combined adverse effects of puberty and diabetes on insulin action may help explain why control of glycemia is so difficult to achieve in adolescent patients
 hyperinsulinemia in a population at high risk for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 the prevalence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (niddm) is higher in mexican americans than in non-hispanic white americans, even after adjustment for the former's greater overall and more centralized adiposity
 we performed oral glucose-tolerance tests with measurements of serum insulin concentrations in 225 mexican americans and 180 non-hispanic whites without diabetes as part of the san antonio heart study, a population-based study of risk factors for diabetes
 natural course of insulin resistance in type i diabetes
 to examine the natural course of insulin action in type i diabetes, we followed 15 patients prospectively for one year after the diagnosis of diabetes and also performed a cross-sectional study of 53 additional patients who had had diabetes for 2 to 32 years
 two weeks after diagnosis, the rate of glucose uptake during hyperinsulinemia, a measure of insulin action, was 32 percent lower in the patients with diabetes than in 30 matched normal subjects (p less than 0
 in patients who had had diabetes for one year or more, insulin action was also reduced by an average of 40 percent (although there was considerable variation between patients), and it was inversely related to glycemic control and relative body weight
 thus, in patients with newly diagnosed type i diabetes, a transient normalization of insulin action may occur after an initial reduction, along with a partial recovery of endogenous insulin secretion, and these events may contribute to the development of a clinical remission ("honeymoon" period)
 a majority of patients with diabetes of long duration are characterized by varying degrees of insulin resistance

 immunoreactivity to a 64,000 mr human islet cell antigen in sera from insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients and individuals with abnormal glucose tolerance
 autoantibodies in sera from newly diagnosed insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm) patients recognize a 64,000 mr human islet cell antigen

 we have conducted studies on a mexican-american population in starr county, texas (98% mexican-american) and a tunisian population in tunis, tunisia, to determine if the frequency distribution of these classes of insulin gene alleles are similar to the previously reported frequency distributions and if any of the classes of alleles are associated with type 2 diabetes in these populations
 we conclude that none of the classes of insulin gene alleles are associated with type ii diabetes among mexican-americans or tunisians, and that the frequency distributions of the insulin gene alleles do not vary significantly between the tunisians, mexican-americans, or the aggregate data resulting from combining the insulin gene frequencies of several of the populations described thus far (bell et al
 diabetes, insulin and exercise
 the metabolic and hormonal adaptations to single exercise sessions and to exercise training in normal man and in patients with insulin-dependent as well as non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus are reviewed
 in insulin-dependent (type i) diabetes good metabolic control is best obtained by a regular pattern of life which will lead to a fairly constant demand for insulin from day to day
 thus, physical training can not be recommended as a means of improving metabolic control in insulin-dependent diabetes
 in non-insulin-dependent (type ii) diabetes, exercise is associated with less risk of metabolic derangement, and in genetically disposed individuals physical training may prevent development of overt diabetes possibly by diminishing the strain on the pancreatic beta cell
 affection of the shoulder joint was seen with almost the same frequency in insulin-dependent as in non-insulin-dependent patients, but after a shorter duration of diabetes in the latter

 diminished heparan sulfate concentrations in diabetes may down-regulate the transmission of vagal impulses to insulin-producing pancreatic cells, and thereby impair both the continued vitality of these cells, and the acetylcholine modulated potentiation of glucose-induced insulin release
 we also suggest that women who develop idiopathic toxemia of pregnancy are at increased risk for adult onset diabetes later on in life because they have a mild derangement in glucose-insulin homeostasis during their reproductive years that results in increased uterine vascular damage, that leads to decreased uterine blood flow, and ultimately the fetal hyperinsulinemia-prostaglandin pressor release mechanism
 their use should not lead to the neglect of other facets of management in non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, such as diet and exercise, and the introduction of insulin should not be delayed in subjects who are not achieving an adequate control of blood glucose levels

 we studied 125i-insulin binding to erythrocytes from 14 patients with diabetes secondary to chronic pancreatitis or pancreatectomy and compared the results with those found in 10 patients with type i diabetes and 25 normal controls
 patients with pancreatogenic diabetes had higher 125i-insulin binding and enhanced tissue sensitivity to exogenous insulin measured with the glucose clamp technique as compared with patients with type i diabetes
 the increase in insulin binding to cells from patients with pancreatogenic diabetes in comparison with cells from normal subjects was also seen in young-erythrocyte-rich fractions and in old-erythrocyte-rich fractions obtained from the mixed population of circulating erythrocytes by centrifugation in density gradient of percoll-pielografin
 these data, in the absence of any sign of major hematological disorders, suggest that the increase in insulin receptors seen in erythrocytes and in monocytes from patients with pancreatogenic diabetes, can mirror a general phenomenon on tissues throughout the body, including major target cells for insulin and correlate with the heightened sensitivity to insulin characteristic of these patients
 in conclusion, patients with pancreatogenic diabetes have increased insulin binding as compared to controls and to patients with type i diabetes with chronic hypoinsulinemia of the same degree

 the clinical effects of mixing short- and intermediate-acting insulins in the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes
 premixing short- and intermediate-acting insulins in one syringe, with refrigerated storage before injection, is practised by some centres in the treatment of older patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes
 because other studies have reported the loss of the short-acting insulin component after mixing with intermediate-acting insulins, we examined the clinical effect of mixing soluble insulin with lente or isophane insulins in subjects with non-insulin-dependent diabetes
 even in subjects with endogenous insulin secretion, this effect may have clinical importance and should be taken into account when insulin therapy is adjusted for patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes

 insulin suppression of plasma-free fatty acid concentration in normal individuals and patients with type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes
 in order to define the effect of type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus on the ability of insulin to regulate plasma-free fatty acid (ffa) concentrations, we determined the plasma ffa response to the intravenous infusion of various amounts of insulin
 although plasma ffa concentrations were higher in patients with type 2 diabetes at any given insulin concentration, the relative ability of insulin to suppress plasma ffa concentration to half the initial value was comparable in normal individuals and patients with type 2 diabetes, occurring at a plasma insulin concentration of approximately 20 mu/l

 preventing insulin dependent diabetes mellitus: the environmental challenge
 the epidemiology of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus was evaluated to determine the degree to which the disease results from environmental agents and therefore might be prevented
 the results of research indicate that insulin dependent diabetes can be produced in animal models by environmental factors, there are major geographical variations in diabetes, certain populations have shown rapid changes in incidence over time, migrants appear to take on the risk of diabetes in their new country, and certain viruses and chemicals cause insulin dependent diabetes in humans
 the results of genetic and epidemiological studies also show that at least 60% of insulin dependent diabetes world wide, and perhaps over 95%, is environmentally determined and thus potentially avoidable
 it is concluded that the primary worldwide determinants of diabetes are environmental not immunogenetic and that identifying and altering the diabetogenic environmental factor(s) are likely to be more effective and less risky in preventing insulin dependent diabetes than current immunogenetic approaches
 in a double-blind, randomized, crossover study of the effects of 4 weeks of therapy, each with two dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker drugs, nifedipine and nicardipine, glucose tolerance, plasma insulin levels, and hemoglobin a1 were assessed in 20 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes (mean age 59 years)

 role of lipid oxidation in pathogenesis of insulin resistance of obesity and type ii diabetes
 increased lipid oxidation is generally observed in subjects with obesity and diabetes and has been suggested to be responsible for the insulin resistance associated with these conditions
 we conclude that 1) reduced glucose oxidation and reduced nonoxidative glucose disposal partake of the insulin resistance of nondiabetic obese and diabetic obese individuals; 2) hyperglycemia provides a compensatory mechanism for the defect in nonoxidative glucose disposal in nondiabetic obese subjects; however, this compensation is characteristically lost when overt diabetes ensues; and 3) increased lipid oxidation may contribute, in part, to the defects in glucose oxidation and nonoxidative glucose uptake in obesity
 factors affecting and patterns of residual insulin secretion during the first year of type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus in children

 the genetics of susceptibility to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus--possible new markers
 it is well established that the hla-dr3 and hla-dr4 genes at the hla-dr locus on chromosome 6 are strongly associated with increased susceptibility to insulin-dependent diabetes, and that the predisposition is greatest among individuals who possess both of these genes (that is, are hla-dr3/4 heterozygotes)

 that overt complications of diabetes were not present in any of the individuals, and that blood sugars were maintained close to normal on relatively small amounts of exogenous insulin, suggests a protective function in these patients related to residual secretion of insulin by beta cells
 factors affecting insulin antibody binding in children with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 we have developed a protocol of prophylactic cyclosporin a administration which confers complete and permanent protection against insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in diabetes-prone biobreeding rats
 spontaneous insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus developed in about 50% of biobreeding rats, between 10 and 18 weeks of age
), started at 6 weeks of age and terminated at 21 weeks of age, completely prevented insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus: 0% (0/25) cyclosporin a-treated compared to 46% (11/24) control rats developed insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (p less than 0
 protection against insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was lifelong, provided cyclosporin a prophylaxis was initiated when insulitis was minimal or absent, and pancreatic insulin content was normal
 cyclosporin a prophylaxis initiated later, but still before the onset of clinical symptoms (8-9 weeks), and terminated at 22-23 weeks, was only partially effective; 5/20 (25%) of cyclosporin a-treated rats developed insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, compared to 60% (12/20) of controls (p less than 0
 cyclosporin a prophylaxis started at the appropriate time (6 weeks) but terminated prematurely (17-19 weeks of age) was not effective; insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus developed in 20% (3/15), compared to 50% (7/14) controls (p greater than 0
05); insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus developed after cessation of therapy
 we conclude that effective and permanent moderate-dose cyclosporin a prophylaxis of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in biobreeding rats requires (1) early initiation of treatment, when islet morphology and hormone content are still normal; and (2) prolonged treatment, with continuation of prophylaxis past the end of the at-risk period

 the effects of hyperglycaemia on isotopic measurement of glucose utilisation using [2(3)h], [3(3)h] and [6(14)c] glucose in patients with type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus
 to determine whether hyperglycaemia alters the accuracy with which [2(3)h] and [3(3)h]glucose reflect glucose turnover measured with [6(14)c]glucose in patients with type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus, glucose utilisation rates were measured during a simultaneous infusion of [2(3)h], [3(3)h] and [6(14)c]glucose after maintenance of normoglycaemia overnight and when glucose concentrations were clamped at 5

 we conclude that asymptomatic nocturnal hypoglycemia does not appear to cause clinically important fasting hyperglycemia in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus on their usual therapeutic regimens
75), 18 of whom had type ii and 2 type i diabetes and 11 under treatment by diet and hypoglycaemic drugs or insulin
 taking into consideration the possible causes of these differences, it is suggested that the hgh reserve depends primarily on the metabolic condition of the patients, while the type of diabetes (iddm or niddy) and the insulin therapy used may also be important contributing factors

 a genetic analysis of diabetic and non-diabetic punjabi sikhs (n = 164) was made for markers of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus using insulin receptor, insulin, and hla-d alpha chain gene probes
 in punjabi sikhs and british caucasoids neither of the restriction fragment length polymorphisms distinguished non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus subjects from controls
 in the sikhs no association with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was seen with the hypervariable region of the insulin gene or with hla-dr/dq/dx alpha chain restriction fragment length polymorphisms
 we therefore conclude that despite the high prevalence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in asians we were unable to find any genetic markers for this disease using the available cloned gene probes

 residual insulin positivity and pancreatic atrophy in relation to duration of chronic type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus and microangiopathy
 the relationship of residual insulin positivity in chronic type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes and atrophy of the exocrine pancreas to duration of diabetes, age at onset and microangiopathy was studied in 26 patients (disease duration 2 to 54 years, mean 26 years)
 all patients with diabetes duration less than 11 years had residual insulin cells; whereas, the rate of insulin positivity was near 40% with diabetes duration of more than 11 and 21 years, respectively
 the findings suggest that in about 40% of patients with type 1 diabetes a small population of insulin cells may escape autoimmune destruction, irrespective of disease duration or age at onset
 though exocrine atrophy and insulin deficiency are associated, the variable extent of pancreatic atrophy could not be related to such factors as amount of surviving insulin cells, duration of diabetes or microangiopathy

 obesity, diminished physical conditioning, aging, and diabetes are ubiquitous contributors to relative insulin resistance and all are associated with a tendency for blood pressure to rise
 although type 2 non-insulin-dependent diabetes is a state of increased insulin resistance, hypertension is partly sustained by secondary renal mechanisms
 to examine whether defects in carbohydrate oxidation and thermogenesis in aging, obesity, and diabetes are secondary to impaired insulin action or to a primary defect in intracellular metabolism, we compared substrate oxidation and energy expenditure in 9 younger, 9 older, 9 obese, and 10 non-insulin-dependent diabetic subjects after the ingestion of 75 g of glucose or fructose (a monosaccharide whose transport into the cell and subsequent metabolism are independent of insulin)
 these data suggest that 1) the stimulation of thermogenesis after fructose ingestion is related to an augmentation of intracellular metabolism rather than an increase in the plasma insulin concentration per se, 2) the insulin resistance of aging, obesity, and diabetes is associated with a defect in intracellular carbohydrate oxidation, and 3) the cellular mechanisms involved in carbohydrate-induced thermogenesis are not primarily impaired in insulin-resistant states

 [principles of immunotherapy in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus]
 there is now convincing evidence that insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes mellitus is an immunological disease
 this is derived from observations of a genetically determined predisposition, an association of recent-onset diabetes with viral infections, an inflammatory cell infiltrate affecting the islets of langerhans, autoantibodies against islet cells, insulin, insulin receptors, and other organ-specific or non-organ-specific antigens, as well as abnormalities of cell-mediated immunity and of non-antigen specific mediators
 finally, recurrent diabetes in cases of pancreas transplantation in monozygotic twins discordant for insulin-dependent diabetes underlines the influence of an autoimmune insulitis
 the current concept of the aetiopathogenesis of most cases of insulin-dependent diabetes is that in genetically susceptible individuals any form of damage to beta cells by viral, toxic, dietary or other environmental factors may initiate beta cell destruction and/or aberrant antigen expression, followed by a self-perpetuating, mostly cell-mediated autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing cells
 successful immunoprevention in autoimmune diabetes models, on the basis of these recent concepts, led to the assumption that immunotherapy by means of immunomodulative or immunosuppressive drugs might be a possible tool in the treatment of patients with recent onset insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes mellitus
 a number of findings concerning the pathogenesis of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus have shown that an autoimmune process is responsible for the destruction of the beta-cell mass, and that a major part of this process has already occurred during the prediabetic phase of the disease
 evaluation of b-cell secretion and peripheral insulin resistance during pregnancy and after delivery in gestational diabetes mellitus with obesity
 eight patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes underwent two 2-wk study periods in random order during which they were provided with carbohydrate foods with either a high or low glycemic index (gi)
 inclusion of low-gi foods into diets of patients with diabetes may be an additional measure that favorably influences carbohydrate metabolism without increasing insulin demand
 to test the hypothesis that short-term insulin therapy may induce long-lasting metabolic improvements in patients with type 2 diabetes resistant to oral therapy, 19 patients were studied before and four weeks after insulin therapy, and again four weeks after resumption of oral medication

 already before diagnosis of diabetes a great variety in pancreatic insulin content and morphometrically determined relative beta-cell volume density were visible
 verified by individual retrospective analysis one part of the rats is characterized by a more chronical course of diabetes development (pancreatic insulin content and beta-cell mass already more than 60 days before diagnosis of hyperglycaemia significantly reduced, occurrence of insulitis) whereas other animals show an acute form of beta-cell destruction (still about 20 days before diagnosis of diabetes pancreatic insulin content and relative beta-cell volume density in a normal range)
 besides a drastical reduction of pancreatic insulin content at the time of diabetes diagnosis intense mononuclear infiltrations in the islets of langerhans causing their destruction are demonstrable
 we conclude that prospective statements on the development of diabetes on the strength of analysis of residual beta-cells and pancreatic insulin content are not possible at present

 in the pedigree with maturity onset diabetes of the young, formal linkage analysis allowed exclusion of close linkage between the insulin receptor locus and diabetes (logarithm of the odds for linkage versus non-linkage was -5
 this confirms the absence of linkage between insulin receptor and diabetes which has been reported in two similar pedigrees
 in the three type 2 diabetic families there were a minimum of 4 recombinants between the insulin receptor locus and diabetes, which makes a direct role for insulin receptor defects unlikely
 in contrast to the one previous linkage analysis study of the insulin receptor gene, no specific association of diabetes with the rare sst1 s1(-) allele was observed in either the maturity onset diabetes of the young or the type 2 diabetic families

 insulin autoantibody polymorphisms with greater discrimination for diabetes in humans
 insulin autoantibodies, like islet cell antibodies, are found not only in the sera of newly diagnosed type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients and their relatives, but also in patients with other autoimmunities who do not develop diabetes
 as determinant selection is genetically determined, we questioned whether certain polymorphisms of insulin autoantibodies, identified by their binding site on the insulin molecule, could better discriminate for type 1 diabetes, which is also hla determined
 two of these polymorphisms, type a and type b, were subsequently found in insulin autoantibody positive human sera using the same panel of insulin variants, and successfully distinguished diabetes-related from diabetes-unrelated individuals
 thus, the type b polymorphism was responsible for binding in 60% of 41 insulin autoantibody positive individuals with polyautoimmune disease but no personal or family history of diabetes (diabetes unrelated), but in only 2% of a group which comprised 17 newly-diagnosed insulin autoantibody positive type 1 diabetic patients, 19 insulin autoantibody positive discordant twins of type 1 diabetes and six insulin autoantibody positive healthy siblings of type 1 diabetic patients (diabetes related) (p less than 0

 both igt and diabetes, on the other hand, were associated with increased plasma insulin and free fatty acid (ffa) levels, both in the fasting state and following glucose ingestion (p = 0
 we conclude that: (a) increased lipid oxidation is common in obesity, but is not sufficient to explain the deterioration of glucose tolerance in long-term obesity; (b) very-long-term obesity may be associated with partial exhaustion of the beta cell, and the resultant insulinopenia may cause depressed glucose oxidation and impaired glucose tolerance, and (c) a defect in nonoxidative glucose disposal is a characteristic feature of frank diabetes at any stage of obesity
 changes in insulin responses and binding in adipocytes from monkeys with obesity progressing to diabetes
 to gain insight into cellular events associated with the progression of obesity to diabetes, we have studied glucose metabolism and insulin responses in adipocytes from monkeys with spontaneous obesity
 over a 3- period, we studied animals which (a) remained relatively lean; (b) became obese (over 30 percent body fat) with normal glucose tolerance; (c) were obese and developed hyperinsulinemia (over 100 microu/ml); and (d) were obese and subsequently developed noninsulin-dependent diabetes (niddm) (fasting plasma glucose above 140 mg/dl and abnormal glucose tolerance test)

 when persistent proteinuria developed after the diagnosis of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, the cumulative risk for chronic renal failure 10 years after the diagnosis of persistent proteinuria was 11%
 these population-based data suggest that most cases of chronic renal failure in diabetes occur in persons with non-insulin-dependent diabetes
 these data also identify the increased risk for chronic renal failure among persons with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who have persistent proteinuria present at or developing after the diagnosis of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, such data may be useful for directing interventions to prevent or delay the development of chronic renal failure

 serum insulin concentrations are higher in persons with a positive parental history of diabetes than in persons without such a history
 since hyperinsulinemia is associated with both an increased prevalence of hypertension and an atherogenic pattern of serum lipids and lipoproteins, we hypothesized that among nondiabetic persons, a parental history of diabetes would be associated with an atherogenic pattern of cardiovascular risk factors

 diabetic nephropathy ultimately develops in approximately, 40 percent of patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, as well as in a significant fraction of those with non-insulin-dependent diabetes
 recent studies indicate that the subset of insulin-dependent diabetic patients who develop nephropathy may have a genetic susceptibility to renal injury resulting from the abnormal physiologic milieu associated with diabetes
 patients with diabetes mellitus, whether insulin-dependent or non-insulin-dependent, are at increased risk for developing systemic arterial hypertension
 in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus without nephropathy or overt fluid retention, diuretic therapy could be replaced by sodium restriction and/or calcium channel blocker therapy, since these agents also have a mild diuretic effect
 the prevalence of hypertension in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (niddm) is considerably higher than in the non-diabetic population
 apart from grade ii and iii obesity, several patients suffered from dyslipidaemia (group a: n = 10; group b: n = 7), non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (niddm) (group a: n = 4; group b: n = 3) or igt (group a: n = 8; group b: n = 6)

 insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is caused by autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas
 the hsp65-cross-reactive antigen, the autoantibodies, and the t-cell reactivity then decline with the development of overt insulin-dependent diabetes
 the importance of hsp65 in the pathogenesis of insulin-dependent diabetes was confirmed by the ability of clones of anti-hsp65 t cells to cause insulitis and hyperglycemia in young nod/lt mice

 given the importance of ion channels in cell physiology, a knowledge of the structure and properties of these channels in the beta-cell is required for understanding the abnormalities of insulin secretion that occur in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 insulin gene in diabetes
 insulin deficiency is a prominent feature of non-insulin-dependent (niddm) and insulin-dependent (iddm) diabetes mellitus that could result from defects in the insulin gene
 the combined rflps for the insulin, igf-ii, and tyrosine hydroxylase genes make this a highly informative locus for genetic studies of the insulin gene in diabetes
 these studies have failed to demonstrate a major significant role for insulin-gene defects in niddm, maturity-onset diabetes of the young, or iddm in american blacks and whites and under various models of inheritance
 several pedigrees with diabetes and defects of the insulin gene have been described, however, and a minor role for this gene in niddm cannot be eliminated from available studies
 seven undernourished and seven obese, insulin-requiring type 2 diabetic subjects, who were matched for age, sex, and duration of diabetes, were subjected to oral glucose tolerance tests
 young diabetics in tropical countries are often undernourished, insulin-requiring and ketosis-resistant, and are sometimes considered to have a distinct type of diabetes
 il-1 beta, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin-dependent diabetes, may therefore mediate its opposing effects on beta-cells through a specific plasma membrane receptor

 effects of streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus on growth and hepatic insulin-like growth factor i gene expression in the rat
 we undertook this study in young rats to determine whether the reduction in growth rate associated with streptozotocin (stz)-induced diabetes might be related to changes in both serum insulin-like growth factor i (igf-i) and igf-ii levels, and, if so, whether these changes reflect alterations in serum growth hormone (gh) and in hepatic igf-i and igf-ii gene expression
 insulin treatment for 3 to 4 days, started either immediately (6 hours) or within 3 days after administering stz, blunts diabetes-induced impairment of growth and restores mean hepatic igf-i mrna abundance to control levels, but does not normalize serum igf-i and igf-ii concentrations

 pancreatic beta-cell mass is markedly reduced in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and moderately reduced in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 in both forms of diabetes, there are qualitative and quantitative abnormalities of insulin secretion that cannot be explained entirely by changes in beta-cell mass
 because the apparent reduction in cardiovascular risk noted in nondiabetic populations that ingest diets rich in marine lipids containing omega-3 fatty acids is believed to result in part from their capacity to modify the composition and physicochemical behavior of lipoproteins, we sought to determine whether dietary supplementation with marine lipids might favorably affect lipoprotein composition in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm)

 insulin- and anti-immunoglobulin-antibodies have been recently reported in pre-diabetic subjects: the former has been proposed as a predictive marker of type i diabetes in non-diabetic-subjects
 to evaluate the diabetes-related specificity of these antibodies, the presence of insulin autoantibodies, using a recently developed and highly sensitive competitive radioimmune assay, and of anti-immunoglobulin antibodies together with that of immune complexes and of other autoantibodies has been investigated in patients with organ- or non-organ-specific autoimmune diseases
 thus, whereas contrary to expectation anti-immunoglobulin antibodies are not associated with non-diabetes-related autoimmune diseases, increased humoral immunoresponsiveness to endogenous insulin appears to be related to autoimmunity in general rather than restricted to type i diabetes
 kidney tissue insulin-like growth factor i and initial renal growth in diabetic rats: relation to severity of diabetes
 the initial renal hypertrophy in experimental diabetes is dependent on the prevailing blood glucose level and is associated with renal accumulation of insulin-like growth factor i
 therefore, we conclude (1) that the homologous amino acid sequence within iapp and cgrp does not seem to be sufficient for inducing inhibition of insulin release in mice and rats and (2) that the possible involvement of iapp in the pathogenesis of diabetes type 2 still remains speculative
 insulin sensitivity and b-cell responsiveness to glucose during late pregnancy in lean and moderately obese women with normal glucose tolerance or mild gestational diabetes
 women with gestational diabetes mellitus (n = 16) had mean insulin sensitivity that was similar to that of the normal pregnant group, which indicates that insulin action was appropriate for the late phase of pregnancy in the gestational diabetic group
 by contrast, the mean first-phase insulin response was significantly reduced in women with gestational diabetes mellitus, as compared with that of normal pregnant women (p less than 0
 they further indicate that during the third trimester, mild gestational diabetes is characterized by an impairment of pancreatic b-cell function rather than an exaggeration of the normal insulin resistance of late pregnancy
 we compared the glucose, insulin, free fatty acid, and 3-hydroxybutyrate responses to a briefly extended overnight fast during the third trimester of pregnancy between two groups: obese women with normal glucose tolerance (n = 10) and age- and weight-matched women with gestational diabetes mellitus (n = 10)
 prediction of glucose response to weight loss in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 although diet therapy is considered the cornerstone of therapy for obese patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, losing weight is often difficult, and the plasma glucose concentration does not always improve after weight loss
 we looked for predictors of improvement in plasma glucose levels after weight loss in 135 obese patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who had lost at least 9
 we conclude that, in contrast to conventional teaching, many patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus will not have any improvement in plasma glucose levels after a 9
 however, a substantial minority (approximately 40%) of obese patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus have much lower plasma glucose levels with a weight loss of 9

 hba1c and plasma c-peptide were determined in 532 women with type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus, corresponding to approximately 80% of all the diabetic pregnancies in the country during the study period 1982-1985, and 222 non-diabetic control women
 the presence of islet amyloid polypeptide in amyloid within pancreatic islet cells in type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes, and its reported inhibition of glucose uptake by skeletal muscle in vitro, has prompted speculation concerning its role in the pathogenesis of diabetes

 twenty-two patients (16 females and 6 males) fulfilled the criteria for polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type ii and of these 16 had autoimmune thyroid disease and 9 insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 in 7 of 9 patients insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus developed prior to addison's disease, whereas autoimmune thyroid disease was diagnosed before as well as after addison's disease and with a similar age distribution as addison's disease
 in conclusion, the present study indicates that polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type ii occurs in about 50% of patients with idiopathic addison's disease and that autoimmune thyroid disease is more common than insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in these patients
 the present study also indicates that insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus precedes addison's disease in a majority of these patients and usually develops at a young age, whereas autoimmune thyroid disease precedes as well as succeeds addison's disease and occurs at all ages in these patients

 since prediabetic individuals are hyperinsulinemia, and since hyperinsulinemia may be a cardiovascular risk factor, we hypothesized that prediabetic individuals might have an atherogenic pattern of risk factors even before the onset of clinical diabetes, thereby explaining the relative lack of an association of macrovascular complications with either glycemic severity or disease duration
 individuals who were nondiabetic at the time of baseline examination, but who subsequently developed type ii diabetes (ie, confirmed prediabetic subjects, n = 43), had higher levels of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, fasting glucose and insulin, 2-hour glucose, body mass index, and blood pressure, and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol than subjects who remained nondiabetic (n = 571)
 these results indicate that prediabetic subjects have an atherogenic pattern of risk factors (possibly caused by obesity, hyperglycemia, and especially hyperinsulinemia), which may be present for many years and may contribute to the risk of macrovascular disease as much as the duration of clinical diabetes itself

 studies of experimental diabetes in rodents induced by the beta-cell toxin streptozocin have shown that the insulin-resistant glucose transport of peripheral tissues (muscle and adipose) in these animals can be ascribed in part to a pretranslational reduction of the major insulin-sensitive glucose transporter (glut4) in these tissues
 because a central feature of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (niddm) is an imparied ability of insulin to enhance glucose disposal in skeletal muscle, we examined the hypothesis that reduced expression of glut4 is a characteristic finding in the skeletal muscle of subjects with niddm
 neither glut4 mrna nor protein concentration correlated with the degree of glycemic control, fasting plasma insulin or glucose, diabetes duration, body mass index, sex, or age
 thus, unlike streptozocin-induced diabetes in rodents, there is no evidence that impaired expression of the major insulin-responsive glucose transporter is responsible for insulin-resistant glucose transport in the skeletal muscle of these lean and moderately obese niddm patients

 individuals with these mutations have a syndrome of mild diabetes or glucose intolerance, which is inherited in an autosomal-dominant mode and is associated with hyperinsulinemia and altered insulin-c-peptide ratios
 glucose toxicity is a well-established entity that has been shown in animal models of diabetes to contribute to development of insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion
 in type ii (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes in humans, a considerable body of evidence has accumulated indicating that a chronic physiological increment in the plasma glucose concentration leads to progressive impairment in insulin secretion and may contribute to insulin resistance as well
 in animal models of diabetes, development of insulin resistance is related to downregulation of the glucose-transport system, and a similar phenomenon is also likely to occur in humans
 evidence also has accumulated to implicate glucose toxicity in the functional impairment in insulin secretion that occurs during the initial presentation of patients with type i diabetes, and this may explain the honeymoon period so commonly observed after the institution of insulin therapy

 knowledge of normal insulin needs and action is of great clinical importance in the case of insulin replacement in type 1 diabetes, but also for appropriate timing of food intake and initiation of insulin treatment in type 2 diabetic patients
 thus, hyperglycaemia in diabetes mellitus (dm) may be associated by primary insulin deficiency (dm type 1) or by impaired insulin action (dm type 2, early phase) or by both (unsubstituted insulin deficiency in dm type 1; or dm type 2 in its late phase)
 in particular, it is of note that b-cell function and temporal organization of insulin release is profoundly different and not normal in type 2 diabetes though overall absolute insulin release (u/24h) may well be within or above the normal range
 such data are to caution the clinician against premature stimulation of endogenous insulin release by sulfonylureas or against too early initiation of insulin treatment in type 2 diabetes

 non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (niddm) is being increasingly diagnosed as its importance as a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease continues to be recognised
 in type ii diabetes of the obese, decrease in insulin response appears a late phenomenon
 it is now well recognized that insulin resistance and/or hyperinsulinemia are characteristic of a number of common human disease states including obesity, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (niddm), essential hypertension, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
 this may be of clinical relevance, since patients with essential hypertension suffer from reduced insulin-sensitivity and some studies showed an increased incidence of diabetes type ii with beta-blocker-treated hypertensive patients
 early antihypertensive intervention in diabetes often means intervention in a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors including glucose intolerance per se, hyperlipidemia, obesity and hypertension, which are not just coexistent but may be causally linked together by the resistance of peripheral tissues to the action of insulin
 the majority of the available studies in type ii diabetes report a reduction of insulin resistance and a marginal improvement of metabolic control
 subjects with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus exhibit a 3-4 times higher rate of cardiovascular mortality than non-diabetic persons
 the results are interesting, since the amino acids present at residue 57 of the dq beta chains seems to play an important role in determining susceptibility to develop or protection against insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus

 when this technique was used to compare gluconeogenesis rates in non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and nondiabetic patients, gluconeogenesis was found to be increased threefold in the patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (12
 furthermore, the increase in gluconeogenesis could explain more than 80% of the increase in overall hepatic glucose output in patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus
 in conclusion, in non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, gluconeogenesis, as measured by a new isotopic technique, is increased and this increase represents the main cause for increased overall hepatic glucose output and fasting hyperglycemia
 evidence for a primary role of insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes
 relatives of type 2 diabetic patients, who have normal glucose tolerance, are characterized by hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance compared to relatives with no family history of diabetes
 these data suggest that hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance rather than insulin deficiency predict the subsequent development of type 2 diabetes in individuals genetically susceptible to the disease
 as insulin resistance can be ameliorated with therapeutic measures such as weight loss and exercise, apparently healthy individuals with high insulin concentrations and a family history of type 2 diabetes might be regarded as a high-risk group which will require intensive attention from health care professionals

 [serum levels and urinary excretion of zinc in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes]
 serum levels and urinary excretion of zinc (zn) in insulin dependent diabetes
 the authors did not reveal a correlation of serum zn levels with parameters of compensation of diabetes nor with the insulin dose
 thus insulin dependent diabetes nor its metabolic compensation do not influence in a marked way serum zn levels but lead to higher urinary zn losses
 we investigated the effects of streptozotocin-induced diabetes on atrial natriuretic peptide (anp) synthesis, hemodynamic parameters, blood volume, and histopathology, as well as the reversibility of such effects with insulin therapy in wistar-kyoto (wky) rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (shrs)
 the present study indicates that 1) anp synthesis is significantly augmented in the streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat compared with that in the normal rat, and the combination of diabetes and hypertension produces an earlier and greater effect in stimulating cardiac anp synthesis than does either disease alone; 2) an elevation in the intraventricular filling pressure that occurs before observable cardiomyopathic histopathological alterations might be involved partially in the augmented anp synthesis; and 3) the reversibility with insulin therapy suggests that the streptozotocin-induced alterations observed in cardiac anp synthesis and hemodynamics result from insulin-deficient diabetes mellitus, not from cardiac toxicity of streptozotocin

 why, which, and how? although controversies remain as to the usefulness of sulfonylureas, most evidence is in favor of their use in many if not patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 in the first study, the levels of plasma glucose, insulin, and c-peptide were measured after intake of 10 mg glyburide alone or together with a standardized mixed meal in 10 non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (niddm) patients treated with 10-20 mg glyburide/day for greater than 2 yr
 the ability of acarbose to lower plasma glucose concentration was studied in 12 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (niddm) who were poorly controlled by diet plus sulfonylurea drugs
 the patients had non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (niddm) and poor glucose regulation, despite maximal sulfonylurea therapy
 for the past few years, interest has focused on the combination of insulin and sulfonylurea in the search for effective treatments for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (niddm) patients who fail on oral hypoglycemic agents
 therefore, most studies have failed to demonstrate improved glycemic control after adding sulfonylurea to insulin therapy in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus

 strong association between diabetes and displacement of mouse anti-rat insulinoma cell monoclonal antibody by human serum in vitro
 the relevance of these beta-cell epitopes to human insulin-dependent diabetes (iddm) was demonstrated by the differential ability of human serums from control and diabetic children to displace the radiolabeled moabs from the rin5f cells
 thus, englitazone has 1) insulinomimetic and insulin-enhancing actions in vitro and 2) glucose-, insulin-, triglyceride-, and cholesterol-lowering properties in an animal model of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (niddm) in which sulfonylureas have little or no effect
 the results were compared with those of 5 nondiabetic patients with kidney transplantation only, who had native innervated pancreases with portal insulin delivery and were receiving an equivalent triple immunosuppressive therapy (cyclosporin, azathioprine, and prednisone), and 7 healthy control subjects with no family history of diabetes
 limited duration of remission of insulin dependency in children with recent overt type i diabetes treated with low-dose cyclosporin
 preliminary data from our group indicated that cyclosporin a induced frequent remissions of insulin dependency in a group of 40 insulin-dependent (type i) diabetic children if given at the onset of clinical manifestations of diabetes
 to test the general applicability of the hypothesis that diabetes mellitus causes increased polyol pathway activity, decreased tissue free myo-inositol, and resultant pathological changes in tissues susceptible to the ravages of diabetes, we measured glucose, sorbitol, and myo-inositol with quantitative histochemical techniques in layers of the cornea, the aortic myointima, the cardiac left ventricle and atrioventricular node (avn), and retina and kidney after 19 days or 2 mo (mildly diabetic non-insulin-treated [md] and severely diabetic insulin-treated [sd] groups) in the alloxan-induced diabetes model
 when insulin in the plasma of three of these animals was analysed by reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography, only rat insulins i and ii, but not porcine insulin was detectable, indicating unambiguously that at the time of analysis, the correction of diabetes in these animals was due to the function of the recipient's own pancreas rather than the continued, long-term, function of the implanted porcine islets
 incidence of juvenile type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus in france
 the incidence rate of juvenile type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes in france was reported as the lowest in europe 13 years ago, but during the recent years increasing rates have been observed in different european countries

 the prodromal phase of type i diabetes is characterized by the presence of a series of autoantibodies reacting with distinct autoantigens [anti-insulin, anti-64 kda, islet cell antibodies ('antiganglioside')]
 anti-insulin autoantibodies appear to be unique in that the levels of such antibodies correlate with both the rate of progression to diabetes and age at which type i diabetes develops
 induction and pathophysiology of remission of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus during administration of ciclosporin
 ciclosporin-induced noninsulin-receiving remissions in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus are associated with enhancement of beta-cell function
 in both noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and streptozotocin-diabetic rats, insulin resistance is associated with 50% transporter depletion in the intracellular pool, thus leading to a decreased number of transporters appearing in the plasma membrane in response to insulin
 it is concluded that impaired glucose transport in diabetes is secondary (1) to intracellular transporter depletion, and (2) to the presence of inhibitory factors interfering with the full expression of glucose transporters at the plasma membrane, thus contributing to postreceptor insulin resistance
 comparison of captopril and enalapril in the treatment of hypertension in patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and nephropathy

 recent studies have indicated that the blood glucose level of rats with streptozotocin (stz)-induced diabetes (type 1) is normalized without an increase in the plasma insulin level by administration of sodium orthovanadate in the drinking water
 in this study, we investigated whether vanadyl ion, which is less toxic than vanadate to rats, also has an insulin-like effect in rats with stz-induced diabetes
 this study demonstrated that: (1) vanadyl sulphate (+4 oxidation state), like vanadate ion, normalizes the blood glucose levels of rats with stz-induced diabetes; (2) the action of vanadyl ion is peripheral; and (3) the active form of vanadium for an insulin-like effect may be a vanadyl form, not vanadate

 from a group of 13 obese subjects with normal glucose tolerance (ngt), four developed impaired glucose tolerance (igt); from a group of nine patients with igt, three developed non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (niddm); five of six obese niddm subjects with high insulin response developed niddm with low insulin response
 five patients had diabetes with hypoinsulinemia initially
 these results confirm cross-sectional studies that suggest successive phases in the evolution of obesity to diabetes: a, ngt; b, igt (the hyperglycemia normalizing the glucose storage over 3 hours); c, diabetes with increased insulin response, where hyperglycemia does not correct the resistance to glucose storage anymore; and d, diabetes with low insulin response, with a low glucose storage and an elevated fasting and postload glycemia
 these results strongly suggest that metformin improves type 2 diabetes through an effect at the hepatic level on both insulin action and insulin-induced resistance
 effect of long-term monitoring of glycosylated hemoglobin levels in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 we undertook this study to determine whether knowledge of hemoglobin a1c values would result in improved metabolic control in a group of patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm)
 the patients in the group whose hemoglobin a1c level was monitored were seen and their insulin regimens changed more often, but they were hospitalized for acute care of their diabetes less often than those in the control group

 the presence of cytoplasmic islet-cell autoantibodies has been recognized as a risk factor for the development of diabetes mellitus in relatives of patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm), but the magnitude of the risk is unknown, as is the influence of other factors, such as age, sex, and race
 lipoatrophic diabetes mellitus is a rare syndrome characterized by lipoatrophy and insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus
 the presence of an amino acid other than aspartic acid at position 57 of the hla-dq beta chain (non-asp-57) is highly associated with susceptibility to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm), whereas an aspartic acid at this position (asp-57) appears to confer resistance to the disease
 in a pilot study, controls and a subject with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm) were exercised at 0800 and 2000 hours: pedaling on an exercycle for 30 minutes at rates that maintained tachycardia at 70% of maximum reserve heart rates (karvomen et al

 lung function was assessed in 35 nonsmoking adults with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and 34 matched control subjects
 the major genetic markers associated with the development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm) is the possession of the hla alleles dr3/dr4 and more recently the absence of aspartate in the 57th position on the beta-chain of the hla dq gene (hla dq beta asp 57 negative)

 is islet amyloid polypeptide a significant factor in pathogenesis or pathophysiology of diabetes? islet amyloid polypeptide (iapp) or amylin, a recently discovered minor secretory peptide of the beta-cell related to calcitonin gene-related peptide (cgrp), is a constituent of amyloid deposits in the islets of many non-insulin-dependent (type ii) diabetic individuals and some elderly nondiabetic subjects
 what is its relationship to diabetes? islet amyloid polypeptide (iapp) or amylin is a newly identified 37-amino acid cooh-terminal-amidated polypeptide that is the major protein constituent of amyloid deposits in insulinomas and amyloid deposits in pancreatic islets of non-insulin-dependent (type ii) diabetic humans and adult diabetic cats
 a significant causal relationship between iapp and type ii diabetes is based on reports that iapp inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin release by beta-cells and that iapp inhibits insulin-stimulated rates of glycogen synthesis and glucose uptake by skeletal muscle cells

 non-ketotic diabetes mellitus caused a marked increase in 125i-labelled insulin-binding sites in both the liver and kidney with the former tissue exhibiting a time-dependent (7 to 62 days) increase
 there was no apparent effect of diabetes on insulin-binding sites in the heart
 since experimental diabetes causes (1) a decrease in circulating insulin concentration and (2) impaired insulin action at many target tissues, the increase in 125i-labelled insulin-binding sites observed in the present study may represent a compensatory 'up regulation' of insulin receptors
 to assess how an isolated change in the pattern of care influences outcome of care and hospital use, a randomised prospective 2-year study was done in which 31 of 61 consecutive children with newly diagnosed insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm) were admitted to hospital at disease onset for about a week and compared with the other 30 children who were admitted for about 4 weeks

 insulin resistance and diabetes due to different mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of both insulin receptor gene alleles
 mutations in the insulin receptor gene can lead to in vivo and in vitro insulin resistance and can be the cause of diabetes mellitus in selected patients
 in summary, (1) we have identified a patient and her family with a genetic form of insulin resistance and diabetes due to a defect at the level of the insulin receptor; (2) the proband is a compound heterozygote displaying a missense mutation (position 981) in one allele and a nonsense mutation (position 988) in the other insulin receptor gene allele; (3) the missense mutation is in the kinase domain and encodes a receptor with impaired in vitro kinase activity; and (4) based on the in vitro and in vivo phenotype, the kinase domain mutation at position 981 is biologically significant leading to insulin resistance
 using the polymerase chain reaction we have amplified parts of the insulin gene from 130 subjects to look for mutations which may be in linkage disequilibrium with the class 3 allele and hence explain its association with non-insulin dependent diabetes (niddm)
 no differences in allelic frequency were found in the south indians or punjabi sikhs between controls and the different types of non-insulin requiring diabetes (niddm, fibrocalculous pancreatic diabetes and maturity onset diabetes of the young) when both groups were matched for insulin genotypes
 thus, although this polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region of the insulin gene is in linkage disequilibrium with the class 3 allele, it does not appear to be any better at predicting diabetes than the class 3 allele itself

 we have assessed the time course of alterations in several biochemical parameters and expression of specific mrnas in gastrocnemius muscle following both the induction of diabetes and the administration of insulin to diabetic rats
 therefore, we conclude that poly(a)+ rna is more stable than ribosomal rna during diabetes, whereas the amounts of poly(a)+ rna and ribosomal rna are increased at the same rates following insulin administration to diabetic animals
 insulin resistance is accentuated during periods of poor metabolic control in human non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus

 sex differences in the mortality associated with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in four countries
 no marker except repeated fasting glucose determinations has proven useful to ascertain prospectively which women with gestational diabetes mellitus will remain euglycemic by diet modification or will require insulin therapy
 we screened 183 black women with gestational diabetes mellitus to determine if the presence of islet cell, mitochondrial, nuclear, dna, parietal cell, smooth muscle, thyroid microsomal, thyroid thyroglobulin autoantibodies, or rheumatoid factor predicted the need for insulin therapy to maintain euglycemia in women with gestational diabetes mellitus
 we conclude that screening for autoantibodies in women with gestational diabetes mellitus is not useful in determining which patients will subsequently require insulin therapy during their pregnancies
 insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased frequency of certain histocompatibility antigens located on chromosome six, the most common types being b-8, b-15, dr-3, dr-4, and dr-7

 trends in the prevalence and incidence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose tolerance were studied in micronesian nauruans aged 20 years and above, by linking glucose tolerance data collected during population surveys performed in 1975/1976, 1982, and 1987
 based on world health organization criteria, the age-standardized prevalence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus has remained relatively constant (24
01) or non-insulin-dependent diabetes (irr = 0
05) has decreased dramatically, while progression from impaired glucose tolerance to non-insulin-dependent diabetes has increased (irr = 1

 resistance to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and hyperinsulinemia: role in non-insulin-dependent diabetes, high blood pressure, dyslipidemia and coronary heart disease
 patients with impaired glucose tolerance (igt) and type 2 diabetes have been shown to be more resistant to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake than individuals with normal glucose tolerance
 evidence has also been published showing that first degree relatives of patients with type 2 diabetes are insulin resistant when compared to a matched group of relatives of subjects with normal glucose tolerance
 in addition, it has recently been shown that the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake varies approximately four-fold in individuals with normal glucose tolerance, and insulin resistance of a degree comparable to that seen in patients with igt or with type 2 diabetes is present in a significant portion of the normal population
 the net result of these changes is that plasma glucose and insulin response will be positively correlated within a population composed of glucose tolerant individuals and patients with igt or type 2 diabetes in the absence of significant fasting hyperglycemia
 on the other hand, the relationship between plasma insulin and glucose concentration will be negatively correlated in patients with type 2 diabetes and varying degrees of fasting hyperglycemia

 acute metabolic and hormonal responses to the inhibition of lipolysis in non-obese patients with non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus: effects of acipimox
 increased rates of fatty acid oxidation are frequently observed in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and may contribute to hyperglycaemia by both decreasing peripheral glucose disposal and, more importantly, by increasing the rate of gluconeogenesis and therefore hepatic glucose output

 lifelong enhanced diabetes susceptibility and obesity after temporary intrahypothalamic hyperinsulinism during brain organization
 in both experimental groups with temporary intrahypothalamic hyperinsulinism during brain organization the following results were obtained: 1) higher body weight gain starting at the end of the hypothalamic differentiation period and continuing during juvenile life until adulthood, resulting in increased relative body weight as a sign of obesity; 2) a tendency to basal hyperinsulinaemia in juvenile and adult age; 3) impaired glucose tolerance in adulthood; 4) increased diabetes susceptibility to a single "subdiabetogenic" dose of streptozotocin in adult age
 in view of these and previous observations a teratogenetic role of high insulin concentrations during the organization of glucoregulatory hypothalamic structures is hypothesized and the possible relevance of such hyperinsulinism as a predisposing factor for a lifelong enhanced diabetes and/or obesity risk is suggested

 circulating levels and bone contents of bone gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-containing protein in rat models of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 in order to investigate the pathophysiology of the diabetic osteopenia observed in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, the circulating levels and the bone contents of bone gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-containing protein (osteocalcin) were determined in rat models of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, neonatally streptozotocin-induced rats and in genetic wistar fatty rats
 since it has been established that the plasma level of osteocalcin is well related to bone formation and turnover, the low plasma values in these animal models suggest that bone formation and turnover are decreased in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus

 from the present review it appears that insulin-dependent diabetes is a common finding in chronic pancreatitis, and impaired secretion of insulin from beta-cells of the pancreatic islets is essential for the development of this form of secondary diabetes
 however, in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes secondary to chronic pancreatitis beta-cell function was preserved to a greater extent and glucoregulation was better than in comparable type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients
 immunological phenomena and associations with certain hla-alleles characterizing type 1 diabetes mellitus were not found in insulin-dependent diabetes secondary to chronic pancreatitis

 the reversal effect of insulin on diabetes-induced alterations in beta adrenergic and muscarinic receptors in rat prostate
 previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that 8 weeks after the induction of diabetes by the administration of streptozotocin (stz) there was a downregulation of beta adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors in rat prostate, and that early insulin treatment (started 3 days after the onset of diabetes) prevented these alterations from occurring
 in the present study, the effects of later insulin treatment (started 8 weeks after the onset of diabetes) on the reversibility of diabetes-induced alterations in beta adrenergic and muscarinic receptors in rat prostate were investigated
 three groups of rats were maintained for 16 weeks: 1) diabetics, 2) insulin-treated diabetics (subcutaneously injected with 5 to 8 u per day starting 8 weeks after the onset of diabetes) and 3) age matched controls
 these data indicate that insulin treatment, begun 8 weeks after the onset of diabetes, can reverse the diabetes-induced downregulation of both beta adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors in stz-diabetic rat prostates

 can induce several potential pressor mechanisms: 1) higher plasma noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and adrenaline (epinephrine) levels, suggesting a higher sympathetic tone in obese than in nonobese subjects, and in hypertensive obese than in normotensive obese subjects; 2) similarly, a tendency to hyperaldosteronism, with largely normal plasma renin activity, in obese hypertensive patients; 3) enhanced sensitivity of blood pressure to salt; 4) increased total blood volume (although it is normal relative to body surface area), leading to increased cardiac output and eventually eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy; and 5) increased cytosolic free ca++ levels and reduced intracellular mg++ levels in the blood cells of obese hypertensive patients and patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes, although this finding cannot necessarily be extrapolated to cationic levels in vascular muscle cells

 genetic polymorphism of factor b (bf) and c3 component of complement in type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus: bfqo allele observed in a diabetic child
 association between insulin resistance and hypertension: insulin resistance and reactive hyperinsulinemia occur not only with obesity, impaired glucose tolerance or non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus, but also in many non-obese, non-diabetic patients with essential hypertension and their currently normotensive, lean young offspring and in some other conditions known to promote hypertension
 therefore, the common coexistence of a genetic predisposition for hypertension with insulin resistance helps to explain the frequent, although temporally often dissociated, occurrence of hypertension as well as dyslipidemia, obesity and type 2 diabetes in a given subject

 among the 1826 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, 52 underwent 73 lower-extremity amputations, and the subsequent incidence of lower-extremity amputation among these residents was 388 per 100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval, 304 to 487)
2% in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and 11
0% in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 when compared with lower-extremity amputation rates for rochester residents without diabetes, patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus were nearly 400 times more likely to undergo an initial transphalangeal amputation (rate ratio, 378
 in this community, more than 60% of lower-extremity amputations were attributable to non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 enrichment with apolipoprotein e characterizes postprandial tg-rich lipoproteins in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease: a preliminary report

 the relative contributions of a direct effect of insulin insufficiency and the hypogonadal effects of diabetes, however, are not known
 diabetes mellitus type ii (insulin-nondependent diabetes) is a disease conditioned by a dysbalance between insulin secretion and effect; it has not been decided whether the cause is insulin resistance or impaired insulin secretion, although a defect of insulin secretion for the manifestation of the disease is generally accepted
 the purpose of the submitted study was to assess to what extent insulin secretion and its effect after an oral glucose load and a hyperglycaemic clamp is affected in different groups of non-obese patients with diabetes type ii
 all investigated groups of type ii diabetics had a comparable degree of insulin resistance which did not depend on the duration of diabetes, its compensation or the type of treatment
 our findings suggest that gh may act indirectly to promote igfbp-3 generation in vivo via increasing both the secretion of insulin and the hepatic production of igf-i; in patients with diabetes mellitus, reduced circulating levels of igfbp-3 despite high levels of gh may result from both insulin deficiency and inadequate hepatic production of igf-i
 the failure of igf-i to induce greater glucose utilization than insulin during hyperglycemia, the greater rise in lactate with igf-i treatment, and the absence of differential effects on proteolysis indicate that igf-i might have only limited clinical application in the treatment of diabetes
 in this study glucose concentration was assayed in blood and vitreous samples obtained from three patient groups undergoing vitrectomy: nondiabetic patients (nd), diabetic patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm) and diabetic patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (niddm)

 a site-by-site follow-up study on the effect of controlled versus poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 in the present site-by-site follow-up study, the change in amount of approximal alveolar bone was assessed after 1 year from the baseline examination in 38 and after 2 years in 22 dentate subjects all with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 the diabetics, aged 35 to 56 years at baseline, had a history of a mean duration of 18 years of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and were under medical treatment at the outpatient clinic of the iii department of medicine, university central hospital of helsinki as well as at 2 diabetic clinics of the helsinki health centre
 based upon their long-term medical records, 26 subjects were after 1 year, and 16 subjects after 2 years from the baseline, identified as having poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes (pidd)
 at the 1-year examination, 12 subjects were classified as having controlled insulin-dependent diabetes (cidd) as compared to 6 subjects at the 2-year examination
 the results of our current 2-year longitudinal site-by-site examinations confirm earlier results that poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is strongly related to the amount of alveolar bone loss

 effects of combined insulin and sorbinil treatment on diabetes-induced vascular dysfunction in rats
 these experiments were undertaken to assess the effects of combined treatment with insulin (designed to partially restore metabolic control) and sorbinil (an aldose reductase inhibitor [ari]) versus the effects of sorbinil alone or of two insulin regimens providing different degrees of glycemic control on diabetes-induced metabolic derangements and vascular function
 regional vascular 131i-albumin permeation was increased about twofold to threefold by diabetes in ocular tissues, sciatic nerve, aorta, diaphragm, and new granulation tissue; it was decreased (but not normalized) by insulin treatment in accordance with improved metabolic control, and was completely normalized by sorbinil

 lack of association of the insulin gene region with type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus in japanese subjects
 although the insulin gene region is implicated in susceptibility to type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus in caucasians, significance of this region to type 1 diabetes in japanese remains unclear because the class 1 alleles (shorter insertion) of the variable number of tandem repeat in the 5' region of the insulin gene are predominant in both diabetic and non-diabetic subjects
 the polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region of the insulin gene (1127/psti) was also analysed and found to be tightly linked to the 5' insulin gene polymorphism, and thus was not associated with diabetes
 these results suggest that the insulin gene region is not a valuable genetic risk factor for type 1 diabetes in japanese
