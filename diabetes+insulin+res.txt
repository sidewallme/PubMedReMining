 reduction of the ffa and catecholamine reserves in the insulin-resistant patients suffering from diabetes mellitus is postulated to be one of the main factors in the resistance pathogenesis [724670]

[developed/VBD]
 ljm occurred in 60 of the 82 diabetic subjects (73%) receiving insulin therapy who developed diabetes after the age of 35 years [3947142]
 1) immediately after resection of more than 84% of the fibrotic pancreas, diabetes developed, and insulin and glucagon secretion decreased, accompanied with marked degeneration of b, a and d cells in the islets [3283522]

[attending/VBG]
 of insulin-treated patients attending the diabetes clinic, 3 [3883109]
 urinary albumin excretion was compared in 32 maoris, 34 pacific island polynesians and 66 subjects of european origin with non-insulin-dependent diabetes attending a diabetes clinic in wellington, new zealand [2298119]

[depends/VBZ]
 to determine whether suppression of gp in diabetes depends on portal insulin levels, we performed 3-h glucose and specific activity clamps in moderately hyperglycemic (10 mm) depancreatized dogs, using three protocols: (a) 54 pmol [1430203]

[occurred/VBD]
 treatment was with insulin in 5 (onset 17-29 years), tablets in 3 (onset 32-70 years), and in one diabetes occurred before the insulin era [3308604]

[involve/VB]
 as well, genetic defects that give rise to diabetes mellitus may involve insulin-dependent reactions or, as a theoretical consideration, be independent of hormonal actions [13967777]

[affects/VBZ]
 our previous study showed that syrian hamsters recover from streptozotocin (sz)-induced diabetes spontaneously and that insulin therapy adversely affects diabetes [1724260]

[classified/VBN]
 in conclusion, in middle-aged patients with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus classified as non-insulin-dependent, diabetic symptoms at diagnosis did not predict the 5-year outcome of the patients in terms of metabolic control or cardiovascular events [1588265]

[manage/VB]
 patients on insulin only reported parents and/or siblings with diabetes less often than did patients using insulin and oral agents, some insulin, or never any insulin to manage their diabetes [2976768]

[delay/VB]
 it can be induced by as disparate means as tuberculin antigen administration, by interleukin-4 treatments, by transfer of t-cell lines generated in autologous mixed lymphocyte responses, and by immunization to insulin b-chain, whereas oral islet cell antigens, such as insulin, can delay diabetes onset in the nod mouse [8100786]

[have/VBP, decreased/VBN]
 in contrast, women with normal glucose tolerance before conception who develop gestational diabetes have significant decreased insulin sensitivity relative to women in a control group [null]

[being/VBG, misclassified/VBN]
 cn overestimated type i diabetes, 37% of type ii diabetes being misclassified because insulin-treated [1451336]

[induce/VB]
 some viruses and viral proteins suppress the regulatory region of the insulin gene and induce diabetes symptoms [2290417]

[starting/VBG]
 in order to further investigate the behaviour of high density lipoproteins in diabetes mellitus, we studied hdl subclasses, hdl2 and hdl3, in 10 patients with newly detected, untreated insulin-deficient diabetes before starting insulin treatment and after getting a good metabolic control [6365116]

[leading/VBG]
 obesity has been associated with numerous metabolic complications, such as changes in the concentration and/or composition of plasma lipoproteins, glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia leading to diabetes and hypertension [3293359]

[was/VBD, studied/VBN]
 the contribution of the gastric fundus to the hyperglucagonemia of poorly controlled diabetes was studied in insulin-deprived alloxan-diabetic dogs by simultaneously measuring plasma glucagon in the venous effluents of the fundus and the pancreas, and the inferior vena cavae plasma [870572]

[normalized/VBD]
 both high and low doses of protamine zinc insulin normalized diabetes-induced reductions in 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid [5-hiaa; the principal metabolite of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht)] and 5-ht turnover (5-hiaa/5-ht), despite the failure of the low-dose regimen to normalize plasma glucose [null]

[contribute/VBP]
 from the basal plasma insulin and glucose concentrations, the model provides an estimate of the degree to which both beta cell deficiency and insulin resistance contribute to diabetes [386029]

[show/VBP]
 cultured retinal pigment epithelium cells from donors with type i diabetes show an altered insulin response [1917388]

[occurs/VBZ]
 mobilization of these proinsulin-enriched granules may explain the relative hypersecretion of proinsulin that occurs with diabetes [8420818]

[lowers/VBZ]
 high-fiber intake provides well-established benefits for persons with diabetes: it lowers insulin requirements, provides better control of blood glucose, and reduces serum lipids [2996944]

[causing/VBG]
 a structurally abnormal insulin causing human diabetes [381941]

[predisposes/VBZ]
 treatment with neutral protamine hagedorn (nph) insulin predisposes individuals with diabetes to anaphylactoid reactions when given bolus protamine for heparin reversal during cardiovascular procedures [2337121]

[lowered/VBN]
 the concentration of glucose 6-phosphate was increased by insulin and lowered by alloxan-diabetes and adrenaline [5968539]

[averaged/VBD]
 regardless of the metabolic control and duration of diabetes, averaged daily insulin requirements increased twofold from earlier in pregnancy [3902039]

[based/VBN]
 patients were defined as having type 1 or type 2 diabetes based upon early insulin requirement and c-peptide levels [1511573]

[remained/VBD, regulated/VBN]
 her insulin resistance remitted spontaneously and over the next 18 months' observation, her diabetes remained regulated without insulin therapy [436798]

[fluctuating/VBG]
 the db/db mouse provides a good model for type 2 diabetes and for fluctuating insulin and glucagon ratios [2407941]

[owing/VBG]
 errors were greater the lower the turnover rate, and were greatest in patients with diabetes, owing to insulin resistance [2169367]

[correlates/VBZ]
 blood pressure at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes correlates with plasma insulin concentration but not during the next 5 years [3899461]

[requiring/VBG, had/VBD]
 however, patients who progressed to diabetes requiring insulin had insulin responses that were subnormal or below the control mean [1247351]

[was/VBD, associated/VBN]
 this spontaneous recovery from diabetes was associated with hyperinsulinaemia in the fed state [143387]

[did/VBD, develop/VB]
 diabetes developed almost exclusively from low insulin responders in 253 non- or mildly obese subjects, while in 35 severely obese subjects a certain number of 'normal or high' insulin responders did develop diabetes [6393431]

[was/VBD, required/VBN]
 insulin was required for diabetes control in 14% of cases [2519161]

[indicated/VBD]
 oral glucose-tolerance tests with plasma-insulin measurement indicated asymptomatic diabetes mellitus in the majority of patients [1112229]

[resulted/VBD]
 a high proteolytic activity of the blood in decompensated diabetes mellitus resulted in insulin inactivation [3906639]

[influence/VB]
 as gip is known to potentiate glucose-induced insulin secretion and possibly the biosynthesis of insulin, the low ir-gip responses in subjects with type i diabetes may
